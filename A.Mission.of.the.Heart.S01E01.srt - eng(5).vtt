00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.840
In the autumn of
the 12th year of Jingming,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.270
the imperial court was rotten to the core,

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.230
and the government
is in complete disarray.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.630
Twenty thousand taels of disaster relief silver
was robbed beyond the border.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.920
The Emperor was furious.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.360
He issued a secret decree

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.240
to send Lu Zhan, the commander of the Imperial Guard
of the Northern Inspection Division

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.370
to investigate this case thoroughly.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.980
Sir, you've definitely arrested
the wrong person!

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.750
I'm truly innocent!

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.640
You're involved in a big case.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.430
If you continue with your glib talk,

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.840
you won't be able to bear it
when Lord Lu arrives.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.380
​​His title of "Handsome King of Hell​​"​

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.040

I'm doomed.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.120
It seems I cannot escape this.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.430
I am Huang Yu,

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.930
just a menial servant at Xiafeng House.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.470
That night,

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.210
I was merely delivering a letter
for someone.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.740
Are you there, Miss Chuchu?

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.260
Unexpectedly, I broke through
the ambush of the Imperial Guard.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.720
I thought they were burglars

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.110
who had stolen Miss Chuchu's money.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.190
You didn't walk on the right path.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.280

Who are you?

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.360
And who are you?

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.910
Imperial Guards on official business!.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.320
Be quiet.

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:20.579
Catch him!

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.200
I helped him catch the real criminal

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.380
but ended up
being labeled as an accomplice

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.150

Do you not care about

Miss Chuchu's life anymore?

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.110
What happened to Chuchu?

What have you done to her?

Tell us who's behind this
and where the government silver is hidden,

and she will live.

Fine.

I'll tell you.

I'll tell you everything.

My Lord.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.510
You work at Xiafeng House,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.520
so you must know Zhang Chuchu.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.240
Yes, I do.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.760
She's the top courtesan at Xiafeng House.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.690
Everyone in the capital knows her.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.540
When did you last see her?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.590
About 3 days ago.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.360
-I went to clean the room as usual.
-Miss Chuchu.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.150
It was weird.

00:03:58.329 --> 00:03:59.720
-It was past noon.
-Miss Chuchu?

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.320
But Miss Chuchu's door
was still tightly shut.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.590
No need to clean the room today.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.300
No need to come tomorrow or the day after.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.370
Who are you talking to?

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.500
I sensed something was wrong with her.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.540
I was about to ask.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.370
But someone called her away from inside.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.230
That's enough.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.579
You may leave now.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.880
Really?

It's not necessary.

Thank you, My Lord.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:29.820
I'll be going now.

Stop.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.110

Oh, right.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.310
Just a misunderstanding.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.909
A simple misunderstanding.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.390
I'll take my leave now.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.920
I'm sorry.

Has Huang Yu's identity been verified?

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.880
Yes.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.630
Huang Yu is an orphan girl
from Huaishu Street.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.290
She possesses extraordinary strength.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.990
She previously worked with an old coroner

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.190
and knows autopsy and tracking skills.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.310
After the old coroner died,

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.060
she's been taking odd jobs
to make a living

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.860
and carrying corpses at morgue.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.420
Have someone watch her closely.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.660
If there's any unusual activity,

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.120
report to me immediately.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.040
Also,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.070
thoroughly investigate everyone
who entered or left Xiafeng House tonight

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.830
and track down Zhang Chuchu's whereabouts.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:25.710
Yes.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.990
What a coincidence.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.190
I'll use Huang Yu as bait

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.270
to draw the snake out of its hole.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.350
Wang Mang has already stolen
the relief fund,

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.080
and Zhang Chuchu has fled
after hearing the news.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.060
They could have escaped.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.500
Why would Wang Mang risk coming
to Xiafeng House?

My Lord.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.350
The person is dead.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.230
Appears to have died from poison.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.110
It seems someone acted before us.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.820
Is this what Wang Mang came to retrieve?

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.550
Damn Lu

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.560
almost made me late for my job.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.960
Today's work

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.990
feels a bit strange.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.400
These people all look unfamiliar.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.300
Who is it this time?

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.330
The groom is Zhao Wenshu,
son of Zhao Yutang from the Minister of Personnel.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.010
The bride is a daughter from
an ordinary farming family,

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.130
named Qiao Pan'er.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.880
The Minister of Personnel.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.800
This is going to be big trouble.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.020
How did Zhao Wenshu

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.560
die?

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.909
The Zhao family claims
it was an accidental death.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.980
An accident?

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.790
Killed with a single blow.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.400
No signs of struggle.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.620
All these cases occurred
at ghost marriage ceremonies.

The killer comes and goes without a trace.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.510
Rumors say they were taken
by the Ghost King.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.640
Everyone calls it
the Ghost King's Bride case.

Yes.

What has she done this time?

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.800
There was a Ghost King's Bride case
last night,

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.000
and Huang Yu happened to be at the scene.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.760
Why was she there?

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.970
It was Tian Si from Fuyue Teahouse.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:27.520
He introduced me
to this coffin-carrying job.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.400
Well, he told me

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.320
that a family's young son
had died accidentally.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.780
Then, fearing the delay may bring trouble,

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.620
they were in a hurry to bury him.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.810
Was there anything unusual?

Yes, yes.

There was knockout smoke.

I just remember we were walking

and then I passed out.

No wonder there were no signs of struggle.

Why did the killer spare only you?

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.620
Perhaps they thought I looked harmless.

Should we rescue her?

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.360
Not rescue her.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:17.980
The bait we released

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.560
should be in our hands.
