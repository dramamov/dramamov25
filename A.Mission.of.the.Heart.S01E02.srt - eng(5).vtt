[A Mission of the Heart]

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.970
[Episode 2]

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.940
My Lord,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.990
I truly didn't know
it was a ghost marriage.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.800
If I had known that,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.800
I would never have done such a thing.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.350
It's true

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.460
that I'm a bit greedy for money,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.360
but I do have my principles.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.630
Why was I so unlucky

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.540
to stumble upon this murder case?

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.770
If I had known it,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.730
I shouldn't have worked relentlessly

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.140
day and night on that sort of thing

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.950
just to make money.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.980
You shameless woman!

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.030
How dare you speak such explicit words!

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.280
I work day and night.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.780
How is that shameless?

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.770
You even work day and night!

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.260
Ms. Huang, are you full now?

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.539
Yes, I'm full.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.930
Thank you, Lord Shen.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.960
If you have any more questions,
feel free to ask me.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.770
Ms. Huang, it seems

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.610
you're having quite a good time

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.110
in this prison.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.820
Lord Lu.

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.430
Why is he everywhere?

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.830
What brings you here, Lord Lu?

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.130
You're the esteemed Commander
of the Imperial Guard.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.009
Why bother visiting the prison
of our Ministry of Punishments?

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.539
I'm here to claim my person.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.509
Since when did I become his person?

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.009
Your person?

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.729
You don't even know
whose person you've arrested.

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.260
No wonder your Ministry of Punishments
never solves any cases.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.080
Lu Zhan,

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.760
don't push it too far!

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.480
What's going on with these two lords?

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.570
Come with me now.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:18.840
Wait.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.060
Lord Lu, since you just said

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.970
that Ms. Huang is your person,

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.320
then...

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.250
the meal fee...

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.520
is 100 taels.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.590
100 taels?

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.300
What are you standing around for?

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.210
Thank you for the meal, Lord Shen.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.290
I'll take my leave.

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.250
Lord Lu.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.100
Lord Zhao.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.810
Arrest this woman!

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.240
I'd like to see who dares!

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.130
Lord Lu,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.930
what's the meaning of this?

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.140
Do you think

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.640
you can arrest my person at will?

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.270
Lord Lu, you're trying
to harbour a murderer, aren't you?

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.480
Lord Zhao, you are mistaken.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.000
Ms. Huang is a survivor,

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.010
not the murderer.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.520
You're a womanizer
who can't keep his eyes off women.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.510
How can I believe your words?

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.560
Nonsense!

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.350
It's true that my lord
enjoys carousing with women,

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.690
but he would never bend the law
for personal gain.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.020
He always enforces justice impartially.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.110
7 days.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.650
Within 7 days,

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.750
Lord Shen will definitely solve this case.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.690
When did I...

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.840
Am I right,

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.600
Lord Shen?

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.079
I will definitely solve the case

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.310
within 7 days.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.280
What if you fail to solve the case

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.440
within the deadline?

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.490
There's no "if."

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.000
Lord Zhao,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.410
I advise you

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.740
strengthen your guards.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.090
After all,

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.630
in the previous ghost marriage cases,

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.850
none of the involved parties survived.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.399
I don't believe such a thing.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.350
Fine.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.150
I'll give you 7 days.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.380
Let's go.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.440
Damn you, Lu Zhan!

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.960
What gave you the right to decide for me?

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.400
I don't have time to argue with you.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.120
Huang Yu.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.110
Come with me to the crime scene.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.940
My Lord, it's pitch-black here.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.470
Why did you bring me to this place?

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.670
Either find the murderer,

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.850
or be thrown into prison.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.170
The choice is yours.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.340
I'll start looking right now!

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.240
This is the incense that made Ms. Huang
and the others unconscious?

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:34.370
It has a very unique scent.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.980
I've examined the scene.

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.450
The murderer must be quite skilled
in martial arts.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.500
Their attack was quick, precise
and ruthless.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.690
There was no hesitation at all.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.170
Even you and I might not

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.310
have been able to pull this off.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.750
My Lord,

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.659
I found a lead.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.660
The murder must be a woman.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.160
Why a woman?

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.290
Lotus patterns?

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.620
Usually,

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.910
only women have these patterns
on the soles of their shoes.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.060
Judging by the size of this footprint,

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.690
the murderer should be slim

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.480
and aged between 30 and 35.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.270
How did you deduce that
from the footprint?

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.210
It's not hard.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.100
Everyone has a unique height and build,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.130
so their stride length,

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.670
as well as the size

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.250
and depth of their footprints, varies.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.250
Anyway, you'll figure it out
once you've seen enough.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.780
Yu, it seems you know quite a lot.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.930
Screen out the list of people
who fit the criteria

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.260
and show it to Huang Yu.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:48.640
Also,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.150
the murderer

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.300
seems to be very interested
in the ghost marriage bride.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.060
Send someone to the bride's home.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.340
We might find something useful there.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.170
As soon as the murder happened,

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.970
I took our men to the Qiao family.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.770
But they've already run off.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.610
Looks like they're guilty
and trying to hide.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.580
The bride's family has fled,

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.910
but the groom's family is still here.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.640
Send someone to the Zhao Mansion.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.300
We might find new leads there.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:19.760
Let's go.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.810
What does he mean?

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.300
My Lord,

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.650
if there are no other orders,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.000
I'll take my leave now.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.670
Wait.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.090
I hereby grant you special permission

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.440
to join the Northern Inspection Division

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.550
as an unofficial member

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.450
of the Imperial Guard.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:14.130
What's wrong?

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.890
Too happy

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.490
to speak?

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:21.980
Thank you for your kindness, Lord Lu.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.110
But I'm unworthy of such an honor.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.160
I'll have to decline the offer.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.600
Please rest early, My Lord.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.390
Good night.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.180
Good night, My Lord.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:34.590
She declined my offer?

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:41.950
Why are you so nervous?

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:43.419
Don't be such a coward.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:46.900
Father.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.600
I heard something happened
to the Zhao family.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.800
Do you think the Ghost King

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.070
will come for us?

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.550
We've hidden away in this lousy place.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.870
How could the Ghost King possibly find us?

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:57.990
That's true.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.050
P-Pan'er.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.420
What are you yelling about?

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.500
Pan'er died a long time ago!

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.600
Stop being so paranoid all the time!

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.190
It really is Pan'er!
