[A Mission of the Heart]

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.920
[Episode 3]

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.670
[Northern Inspection Division]

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.070
My Lord, you're suspicious of Ms. Huang.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.040
Why do you still try to recruit her
to the division?

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.710
Although she's not off suspicion yet,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.180
she's somewhat competent.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.470
It's better to keep such a person nearby.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.220
We need to work out a way

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.850
to make her willingly join
the Northern Inspection Division.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.270
What about a ruse of self-injury?

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.990
Who is it?

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.780
My Lord?

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.190
What?

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.170
You're asking me to pay ten taels a month
for his medical expenses?

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.110
But he's not so severely injured

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.700
that he needs 10 taels a month
for medical treatment, is he?

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.830
It takes that much for Zhao to recover.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.370
My Lord,

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.090
I only suggested a ruse of self-injury,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.670
not extortion!

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.950
My Lord,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.039
you've seen my humble abode.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.910
Even if I work day and night
without food or rest,

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.509
I still won't be able
to pay that much money.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.300
Considering that I helped you
catch a criminal,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.900
could you reduce the amount?

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.770
I suppose I could.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.660
However,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.000
my mercy is only reserved
for those who work for me.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.259
Now, his real purpose is revealed.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.070
Well,

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.620
Ms. Huang, have you made a decision yet?

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.170
Yes, I have.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.910
It's my honor

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.680
to work for you, My Lord.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.340
[Zhao Mansion]

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.950
Lord Shen, why did you come to my place
instead of working the case

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.750
and hunting after the murderer?

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.700
Being confused about something,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.100
I specially came to consult you,
Lord Zhao.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.829
What is the matter?

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.670
The murderer is said to

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.560
only target the brides of ghost marriages
who died unnatural deaths.

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.860
Shen Pan, what are you implying?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.520
That I killed that bride?

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.730
Did you not?

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.760
Zhao Ming!

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.210
Master.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.370
Where did you find that bride for Wenshu?

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.480
Master,

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.250
she was introduced
by Madam Wang the matchmaker.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.829
How did the bride die?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.720
According to Madam Wang,
she died of illness.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.140
She died of illness at such a young age?

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.150
Yes.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.580
I didn't give it too much thought
back then.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.760
Since the time of her birth
was astrologically

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.820
compatible with the young master's,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.940
I arranged a ghost marriage for them.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.660
Lord Shen, do you have other questions?

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.920
No, not for now.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.200
I'm afraid I may have to

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.200
come and trouble you again
if there are new questions.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.710
Zhao Ming,

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.579
Lord Shen's tea has gone cold.
Replace it now.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.530
No need.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.890
I'll take my leave now.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.190
Show Lord Shen out.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.690
Lord Shen, this way, please.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:37.970
Fresh vegetables!

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.970
Candied haws on a stick!

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.880
Come take a look!

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.620
Have you not found the Qiao family yet?

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.370
No.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.100
Continue the search then.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.450
Also, look for Madam Wang.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.110
Yes.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.940
My Lord,

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.060
isn't that Lord Lu and Ms. Huang?

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.170
Could there be something
going on between them?

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.450
Don't you have better things to do?

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.470
Get back to work!

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.630
Yes, sure.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.690
Lord Shen!

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.650
Yu, what are you doing here?

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.760
Any findings?

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.490
Zhao Yutang said
Qiao Pan'er died of illness.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.440
If that were true,

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.020
why would the Qiao family have run away?

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.330
Too bad
that the entire Qiao family has fled.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.110
I wonder if Madam Wang the matchmaker

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.950
is still still alive.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.700
The Zhao Mansion is large.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.100
I'm sure someone there
will slip and say something.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.240
Why are you looking at me?

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.800
There are many women in the Zhao Mansion.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.060
Getting some facts from them

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.150
won't be difficult for you,

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.570
right, Lord Shen?

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.350
That's not true.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.930
Lord Lu,

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.590
how can I hold a candle

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.600
to a devastatingly handsome man

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.530
such as yourself?

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.450
Spill it.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.370
How did Qiao Pan'er die?

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:01.910
Could you tell me

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.730
how Qiao Pan'er died?

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.570
I don't know how she died.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.210
But I know how I'm going to die.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.190
Am I really that handsome?

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.720
My Lord,

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.140
I think we can

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.770
adopt certain tactics.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.970
Nonetheless,

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.530
we need an elegant gentleman
like Lord Shen

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.730
to carry out the plan.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.270
Really?

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.350
Really.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.680
After all, most women

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.680
would be disarmed and flustered

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.900
by Lord Shen's charm.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.390
Are you

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:33.830
one of those women, Yu?

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:40.560
Fine.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.780
Given all those glowing terms
Yu spoke of me,

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.310
I have no option
but to humbly accept the task.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:47.080
Tomorrow,

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.310
just wait till I bring good news to you.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.050
Officer Huang,

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.190
I'm hungry.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.400
Go buy me some fruits and snacks.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.310
Why are you staring at me?

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.510
This is usually Zhao's job.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.280
But since he's injured now,

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.680
you'll have to do it in his stead.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.000
Don't spend too much.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.110
Sir,

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.600
I'll take all the fried flatbreads.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.070
Yes, miss.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:34.280
Make it quick. I'll come get them later.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:34.960
Okay.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.980
I'll take six steamed meant buns.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.670
Okay.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.590
Here's the money.
I'll come get them later.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:40.130
No problem.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.090
I'll take two of each then.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.510
I'll come get them later.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.409
Here you are.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.600
Miss, the steamed buns are ready!

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.290
Thank you, sir.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.540
Coming right up!

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.580
Put them in my bag.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:53.690
Okay.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.150
Thank you, sir.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.250
Alright.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.550
Why so clumsy, Officer Huang?

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.450
Listen,

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.600
you'll pay for them with your salary
if they're damaged.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.280
Eat up.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.020
Lord Lu,

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.020
what else can I do for you?

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.650
Nothing for now.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.240
Lord Lu.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:25.980
Ms. Huang.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.180
Lord Shen has gone to the Zhao Mansion
for inquiries.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:28.780
What's up?

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.300
I found the Qiao family.

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:32.960
However...

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:34.490
Something happened?

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.690
It has the same smell as the incense
found at the scene of Zhao Wenshu's case.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.180
Why did the murderer strike
when the incense was only half burned?

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.150
My Lord,

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.510
I think

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.770
the three victims were all arranged

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.060
in kneeling positions after they died.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.830
The murderer has more hatred

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.600
for Qiao Pan'er's family
than for Zhao Wenshu.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.770
The murderer meant to make them repent.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.360
Qiao Pan'er didn't die of illness.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.590
If they hadn't been greedy for money,

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.320
they might have escaped death.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.520
That said,
these people got what they deserved.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.780
In a sense,
the murderer did a good thing.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:58.290
Judge the deed, not the thought.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:59.970
No justifiable cause can deny the fact

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.570
that the murderer did wrong.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:04.050
Let's go.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.320
I guess

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.550
Shen Pan has had new discoveries by now.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:08.920
Mao,

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.340
bring the bodies
to the Ministry of Punishments.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.050
Yes.
