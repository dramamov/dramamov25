[A Mission of the Heart]

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.900
[Episode 4]

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.070
You've worked hard, Lord Shen.
Have some tea.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.440
Thank you, Yu.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.780
You have some tea too.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.689
How's the investigation going?

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.760
Lu Zhan,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.260
I'm not your subordinate.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.800
So?

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.410
Well, Lord Shen.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.370
The case is what matters.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.900
The case is more important.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.360
I haven't found anything
about Qiao Pan'er's death,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.090
but Zhao Wenshu's death was no accident.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.520
It was murder.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.880
Murder?

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.080
According to a maid from Zhao Mansion,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.650
Zhao Wenshu, in his daily life,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.850
had a peculiar habit.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.630
He enjoyed tormenting servants
for amusement.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.360
Young Master, please spare me!

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.030
I know I was wrong!

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.090
Please spare me, Young Master!

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.370
Spare you?

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.110
Who do you think you are?

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.290
Please!

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.440
I know I was wrong, Young Master!

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.110
What about that girl, Qingyue?

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.800
She's dead.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.050
To protect Zhao Wenshu's reputation,
Zhao Yutang

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.259
ordered everyone in the mansion

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.320
not to tell anyone about this matter.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.620
But Qingyue was only trying
to protect herself.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.350
How did she end up being killed?

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.110
The servants in Zhao Mansion
all signed indentured servitude contracts.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.970
Their lives

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.120
didn't belong to themselves long ago.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.229
In other words,

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.450
even if the masters of the mansion

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.170
kill these maids and servants,

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.630
the authorities
can't do anything about it.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.460
Besides,

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.670
Qingyue accidentally killed Zhao Wenshu.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.710
They simply have no regard for human life.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.770
It's infuriating!

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.880
Miss,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.690
what are you doing?

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.780
Is this enough?

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.200
Yes. It's enough.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.940
Officer Huang,

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.590
this will be deducted from your salary.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.950
That smell again.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.910
It's the killer.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.120
After her!

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.130
I closed another big deal today.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.420
Stop!

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:42.610
Stop it!

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.700
After her!

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.570
I don't know.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.030
I don't know. I...

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.760
You're Madam Wang,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.090
who arranges marriages for the dead,
right?

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.210
I'm not!

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.660
The Imperial Guard
is investigating a case.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.280
I advise you to confess honestly.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.720
I do arrange marriages for the dead.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.270
Who was the person after you just now?

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.150
I don't know.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.720
I don't know them.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.300
How did Qiao Pan'er die?

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.840
I don't know either.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.490
I only handle the matchmaking.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.010
Ma'am, given your attitude,

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.850
you seem eager to go to prison.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.260
Her family

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.690
poisoned her to death.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.640
Just as I thought.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.060
They all truly deserved to die.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.170
Does Zhao Yutang know about this?

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.079
I don't know,

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.800
but Zhao Mansion's butler

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.380
definitely knows about it.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.520
Huang Yu, what are you doing here?

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.260
Mao,

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.490
keep an eye on Madam Wang.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.550
Make her list all the names

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.560
involved in the ghost marriages

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.450
she has arranged.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.900
The Ghost King might be among them.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.850
Oh, and also,

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.190
interrogate Zhao Mansion's butler

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.750
thoroughly.

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:46.870
Hey, Huang Yu!

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.910
Huang Yu, go after her!

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.050
You both are injured.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.620
I need to take you to a clinic first.
Let's go.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.970
[Wind Inn]

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.050
When did you get into my bed?

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.480
We're both grown men.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.720
Are you feeling shy, Lord Lu?

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.320
You...

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.990
Put your clothes on properly
before coming out!

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.790
Officer Huang.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.800
From now on, you can't

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.660
place me and Shen Pan together again.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.610
Do you hear me?

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.860
I was just trying to save money.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.180
My Lord, as you know,

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.140
I'm just a poor commoner.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.410
How can I afford

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.790
such a high-class room?

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.230
But I couldn't let you two suffer either.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:15.970
This one room alone

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.100
cost me a few months' living expenses.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.190
Yu,

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.840
would you like to consider working for me?

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.280
The salary I offer

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.370
is much more than that Lu Zhan offers.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.120
Really?

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.430
Lord Shen, I wonder

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.200
how much you offer monthly.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.220
Ten taels.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:35.340
That much?

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.120
At this rate,

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.970
I definitely can afford a house.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.030
Just thinking about it
makes me a little happy.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.260
So?

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.980
Yu, what do you say?

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.760
No need to consider it.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.370
No need to consider it.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.500
After all, Lord Lu treats me very well.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.550
How could I do something

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.490
like abandoning loyalty
for the sake of money?

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.090
I appreciate your kind offer, Lord Shen.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.800
By the way,

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.150
Lord Shen,

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.220
we still need to ask someone

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.020
to draw the murderer's portrait

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.900
for a citywide search.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.010
This way,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.160
we should be able to find her soon.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.520
I don't need you to tell me that.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.440
Huang Yu!

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.840
Uncle Fu. What's the matter?

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.620
My son is about to get married.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.920
I plan to use this place

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.020
as their bridal home.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.630
So I...
can't rent this place to you anymore.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.770
Okay.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.680
But Uncle Fu,

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.740
can you give me a few more days?

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.840
I'll leave
as soon as I find another place.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.280
It's not that
I don't want to give you time.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.170
It's just that
my son... is in a hurry to get married.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.210
Is it... Zhao Yutang,
Minister of Personnel?

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.000
Yu, lower your voice.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.820
If someone overhears this,

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.840
we could get into trouble.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.330
Huang Yu,

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.680
we are just commoners
without power or influence.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.980
We're no match for those high officials.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.100
I... have no choice.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.900
Okay.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.180
I'll pack my things and move out now.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.460
I'm sorry, Huang Yu!

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.240
That brat.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:55.630
He's no longer young,

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.280
yet he's not concerned
about his marriage at all.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.930
So I had to travel all this way

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.230
to a Taoist temple
to pray for a match for him.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.380
But it's so late,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.120
will Master...

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:04.740
It's fine.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.340
Even if Master finds out,
he'll just nag a bit.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.970
He wouldn't dare get angry.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.740
You don't need to worry too much.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.760
Didn't we get a very auspicious lot today?

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.250
Perhaps Young Master's match

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.340
will appear soon.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.290
Madam!

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:19.710
Madam, what's wrong?

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.250
Madam! Help!

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.560
Someone help her!

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.440
What happened?

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:24.720
What's going on?

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.380
Let's take her to a clinic now!

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.090
Be careful!

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.190
Li! Li, hurry up!

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.409
Someone has fainted!

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.580
Hurry.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:43.220
Where did you bring someone from
this time?

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.660
No credit this time!

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.790
Madam.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.950
Madam. Madam.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.770
Is this enough?

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.030
Where did you get so much money?

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.320
Could it be...

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.870
you did something illegal?

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:12.980
How could you say that?

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.890
It's my hard-earned money.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.130
Cut the crap and save her! Hurry up!

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:23.880

You save her first!

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.470
What a silly girl.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.020
She can barely feed herself,

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.480
yet she's still helping others everywhere.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.330
Madam is not seriously ill.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:39.980
I'll go prepare some medicine for her.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:40.670

Six days.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.960
Six days?

My Lord, it's very late now.

sleeping in this room.

sleeping in this room?

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.580
My Lord,

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.910
you're not planning... to sleep
in the same room with me, are you?
