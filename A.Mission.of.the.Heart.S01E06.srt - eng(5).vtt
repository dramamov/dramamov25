[A Mission of the Heart]

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:10.880
[Episode 6]

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.920
Chen Zhao from the Ministry of Personnel

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.840
actually died in a brothel.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.580
This is no trivial matter.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.210
There are no obvious wounds
on Chen Zhao's body.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.630
How did he die?

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.320
Could it be from taking love potions?

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.920
Be careful.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.740
There might still be love potions
in there.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.620
Take the cup back for inspection.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.000
Yes.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.030
Lord Shen, come here.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.260
Let's reconstruct the scene.

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.060
All the valuables are gone.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.440
My Lord.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.690
Why are you suddenly so angry?

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.870
You're so fond
of reconstructing the scene, aren't you?

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.630
Zhao,

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.259
you take Huang Yu's place.

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:33.039
I...

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.170
Wait.

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:37.920
I'm only interested in women.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.670
As for men,

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.550
I have no interest.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.720
But why did Chen Zhao

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.460
kill Liu Mei'er?

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:52.850
No,

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.330
it wasn't Chen Zhao.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.970
Why?

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.160
Their body temperatures are different.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.759
Chen Zhao died earlier.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.030
Yu, you can even do autopsies?

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.520
It never hurts to have more skills.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.630
I'm just trying to make a living.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.100
My Lord,

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.150
this will cost extra.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.570
No problem.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.990
I'm sure

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.320
Lord Shen will be willing to pay.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.480
Of course.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.860
I'll go right away.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.840
I've found a clue!

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.930
Look at this.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.470
Under Liu Mei'er's fingernails,

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.880
there are bloodstained skin fragments.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.990
This proves that before her death,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.100
she had a confrontation with someone.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.110
Liu Mei'er's body

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.990
shows signs of being moved manually.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.150
In other words,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.829
there was likely

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.640
a third person at the scene.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.030
Do you think

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.560
Liu Mei'er's death

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.550
could be related to the thief?

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.650
We can't rule out that possibility.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.260
Huang Yu.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.950
Have you figured out the cause
of Chen Zhao's death?

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.440
No, further examination is needed.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.720
But we need his family's permission.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.770
After all, it doesn't look like
he died an unnatural death.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.100
If I perform an autopsy,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.720
there'll inevitably be scratches
on the body.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:21.570
Zhao.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.510
My Lord.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.700
Go to the Chen Mansion immediately.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.040
Yes.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.440
With all these clues,

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.250
if you still can't solve the case,
Lord Shen,

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.620
it'll only prove

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.950
your Ministry of Punishments
is full of useless fools.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.280
My Lord,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.980
couldn't you just put it nicely

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.510
instead of making enemies?

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.630
It's fine.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.340
I will solve this case soon.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.700
Well, Lord Lu,

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.760
you should worry about yourself.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.840
About the official silver case,

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.920
His Majesty only gave you 3 months.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.440
Lord Shen,

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.930
that's none of your concern.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.130
What are you thinking about?

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.750
Nothing. Nothing at all.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:50.890
It just occurred to me

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.070
that I have something to do.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.350
I'll take my leave now.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.780
Farewell, Lord Shen.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.290
Lord Shen is so kind.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.240
All the money was given to me.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.970
Otherwise, I would have

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.830
had to give Lu Sanliang the money.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.530
Lu Sanliang, is it?

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.440
Officer Huang,

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.750
we have a score

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.750
to settle, don't we?

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.140
My waist...

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.850
Help me up now!

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.490
Why should I help you apply medicine?

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.310
You have the nerve to say that?

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:11.650
It's all your fault!

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.050
Right here?

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.860
Don't worry, My Lord.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.710
I won't ask you to take care of me.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.880
You expect me to take care of you,

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.520
just because you fell down?

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.370
Officer Huang!

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.909
Officer Huang!

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.930
What's wrong?

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.010
My Lord.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.060
Why are you...

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:13.690
What's the matter?

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.870
Well,

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.360
Mrs. Chen

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.370
refuses to allow an autopsy
on Lord Chen's body.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.120
This is Shen Pan's case.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.200
Just report it to him truthfully.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.690
Yes.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:41.880
Don't worry.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.500
I won't ask you for the money.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.850
You could have said so earlier!

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.600
Officer Huang,

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.430
in your eyes,

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.280
am I really such a stingy person?

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.230
Aren't you?

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.700
Shall I help refresh your memory?

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.340
Lord Shen,

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.500
these are the exact words from Lord Lu.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.560
Please pass on my thanks to your lord.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.020
You're welcome.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:12.990
I'll take my leave.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:18.890
Mao.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:20.580
Look for anyone

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:21.530
at Xiafeng House

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.420
with a piece missing from their clothing.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.330
Yes, My Lord.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.560
And anyone with scratch marks
on them.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.290
Understood.

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:43.000
Do you really enjoy performing autopsies?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:43.780
Yes, I do.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.960
Then why didn't you keep working
as a coroner?

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.880
With your skills,

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.460
you could've become

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.990
a pretty good coroner.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.310
I also wish I could,

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.090
but it's not that simple.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.060
In this world,

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:00.460
it's hard enough for ordinary people

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.410
without connections to get a job.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.030
And for a woman like me,

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.740
it's even harder.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.680
My Lord, you...

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:20.430
From now on,

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.030
you can keep doing what you like.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.720
Really?

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.340
It'd be even better
if my salary could be raised.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.220
My Lord, are you hungry?

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.840
What would you like to eat?
I'll make it for you.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:44.110
Anything is fine.

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.420
Then I'll just make something simple.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.300
I never knew

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.070
a woman's hair

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.060
could be so soft.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:15.790
Where did it go?

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:17.880
Are you looking for this thing?
