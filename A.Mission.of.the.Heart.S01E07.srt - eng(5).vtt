[A Mission of the Heart]

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.000
[Episode 7]

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.750
Where is it?

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.990
Are you looking for this?

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.360
My Lord,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.900
that belongs to me.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.680
Why do you have it?

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.790
It belongs to you?

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.490
How could a servant like you

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.600
afford such expensive jewelry?

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.689
Someone gave it to me as a gift.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.220
Qiulan,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.640
I'd hate to use force on a woman.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.620
Would you rather confess

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.720
or be tortured by me

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.320
till you spill the truth?

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.560
Tell me.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.580
What exactly happened that night?

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.490
I meant to steal from Ms. Liu

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.050
so that I could pay off

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.980
my brother's gambling debts.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.520
When I

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.250
worked as Ms. Liu's maid,

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.360
I saw

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.700
where she placed her valuables.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.620
That night,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.180
my plan

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.770
was to sneak into Ms. Liu room

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.170
while she was out with Lord Chen.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.539
Stop it, My Lord.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.580
We haven't got in the room yet.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.050
Why the rush?

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.830
Oh, gorgeous.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.289
How can I wait anymore?

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.950
I've been dying to see you.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.720
Oh, My Lord.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.630
Come on.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.170
Come on, give me a smile.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.120
I attempted

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.320
to leave the room
when Ms. Liu and Lord Chen

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.750
fell sound asleep.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.090
But unexpectedly...

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.070
What are you doing here?

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.310
What did you take?

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.630
Please let me go, Ms. Liu!

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.960
I didn't see anything!

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.720
Seeing Liu Mei'er stop breathing,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.860
Qiulan dragged her onto the bed

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.340
to make people think Chen Zhao killed her.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.250
It's exactly what we deduced earlier.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.510
Has Chen Zhao's body been examined yet?

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.560
Yes.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.290
The coroner said

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.640
he died of a cardiac arrest

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.030
caused by over excitement during sex.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.890
Anything unusual about the wine?

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.130
Nothing.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.130
A small dose of ordinary aphrodisiac
wouldn't be enough to kill.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.530
Given all that,

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.910
the Ministry of Punishments
can close the case now.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.130
I wish I could.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.430
But my hunch keeps telling me

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.160
that Chen Zhao's death
isn't as simple as it appears.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.490
What makes you say that?

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.000
When Mrs. Chen came

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.930
to claimed Chen Zhao's body,

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.110
the expression on her face
was rather peculiar.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.070
Lord Shen,

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.280
I'm here

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.620
to claim my husband's body.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.000
Mao.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.190
Yes.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.900
Thanks, Lord Shen.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.050
In theory,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.970
Mrs. Chen should've grieved,

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.660
but I actually caught her smiling.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.420
She even personally came and checked

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.860
if Chen Zhao was dead.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.590
Something must be off.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.220
It's a no-brainer.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.700
I think there's a different cause
of Chen Zhao's death.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.630
Now that you're suspicious,
just conduct an investigation.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.700
Why did you ask us to come?

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.190
I didn't ask for you.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.120
The one I asked for was Yu.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.440
Yu,

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.200
would you join me
in visiting the Chen Mansion at night?

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.860
I guarantee

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.210
there will be a handsome reward.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.220
I disagree.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.150
Who are you to make decisions for Yu?

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.430
Why can't I do that?

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:06.720
Don't you forget

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.130
she works for the Imperial Guard now.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.160
You and I are both officials.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:14.520
We should help each other

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.450
in the course of seeking the truth.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.529
Why draw clear boundaries?

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.920
Shen Pan,

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.600
are all the officers
in the Ministry of Punishments dead now?

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.580
I'm determined to take Yu with me.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.040
Then let's see if you're able to do that.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.020
Lu Zhan is a real punk.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.400
He kept hitting my face.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.760
You big loser.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.370
Lord Shen,

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.610
did your hands get hurt?

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.470
No.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.280
That's good.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.690
It was my face that got injured.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.920
Yu, why did you ask about my hands?

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.620
She's not worried about you,

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.590
but her money makers.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.300
I'm just concerned about you, My Lord.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.140
Lord Shen,

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:53.760
let me put salve on your face.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:55.610
Here.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.490
Does it hurt?

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.580
Not much.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.400
What is this about?

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.810
Don't you see I'm also injured?

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.470
Why are you only treating him?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.150
Those minor injuries of yours

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.030
are barely visible to the eye.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.310
Why even complain?

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.950
Treat them yourself.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:18.860
I'm busy.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.530
Hope to see you again soon, Mr. Wang. Bye.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.410
Sir,
it's been a while since your last visit.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.340
Officer Huang

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.030
is really getting out of line.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.420
Does she even know who her superior is?

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.610
Do you have to be this mad
because she didn't

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.890
treat your injuries?

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.350
What do you know?

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.550
I just hate to lose to Shen Pan.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.040
And you...

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.510
I asked you to choose a place for drinks.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.610
What kind of place is this?

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.320
Sir...

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.930
Look what a place you picked!

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.580
My salary is way too low

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.980
for this place.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.490
If you hadn't objected,

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:59.110
I would've got some girls to this table.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.100
But I'm fine with how it is now.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.830
What nonsense are you talking?

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.920
All men should contribute to the court

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.890
and make achievements.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:06.850
You're right.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.740
But in the matter about Officer Huang,

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.880
I have to say you did wrong.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.060
It was up to her to decide

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.990
whether to assist Lord Shen or not.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.470
Why did you try to make decisions for her?

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.480
Why couldn't I do that?

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.400
She's now working for the Imperial Guard,
isn't she?

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.310
That's true.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.120
But you don't own her.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.240
You can't stop her from making money,
can you?

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.520
When it comes to winning a girl's heart,

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.370
Lord Shen does outperform you.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.490
You should really learn from him.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.820
Are you hearing yourself?

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.890
You'll pay for this meal.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:37.970
My Lord,

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.290
didn't you say this would be your treat?

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.270
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:46.960
Off you go.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.810
Hold on!

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.130
What's the matter, sir?

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:55.460
What kind of wine is this?

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:57.820
It's called "Drunken Dream."

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.320
It nourishes kidneys, boosts virility,

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.540
and enhances pleasure.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.470
It's an exclusive specialty here.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.090
Are there varieties of this wine?

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:08.640
Yes.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.500
Bring them all to me.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.000
Why aren't you moving yet?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.130
Yes, sir. I'll go get them.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.860
Yu, have you eaten yet?

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:21.280
Yes, I have.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.760
I came to see you for real business.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.650
What's this?

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:30.520
The money

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.940
we earned for selling Lord Lu's portraits.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.630
Let's each keep half of it.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.530
No need.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.409
I promised to help you make money.

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:39.419
No way.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.830
How can you not get anything in return
for your effort?

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:42.880
Please take it,

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:43.789
or I'll be too embarrassed

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.360
to ask you
to be my business partner again.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.300
You want me
to be your business partner again?

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.830
Am I disturbing you, My Lord?

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:57.730
Not at all.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.090
It's just...

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.760
that others may think of me

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.780
as a philanderer,

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.840
so they wouldn't fraternize with me.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.670
Do you not mind it at all?

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.530
I don't think
you're like what people say you are.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:15.180
On the contrary,

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.180
in my eyes, you truly respect women.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.070
You wouldn't look down on a female

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:20.600
because of her background.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.680
You've noticed that?

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:26.830
I learned of what Xue Jingshu did.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.420
Although she was a murderer,

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.750
you still kept her

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.400
from unjust treatment in prison.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.530
You also had her body properly buried.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:35.850
So many women

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.990
were assaulted and abused
when they were alive.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.780
Their bodies were left in the wilderness
after they died.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.000
Xue Jingshu was lucky

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.510
to have met you, My Lord.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.930
You should keep all the money.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.020
I'll take it then.
