[Episode 9]

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.230
Huang Yu, you're so pathetic.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.180
How can you be so flustered?

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.300
But

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.550
this love potion

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.130
is really strong.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.240
It actually made the usually
cold and reserved Lu Zhan

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.920
become like this.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.040
Is it really just
because of the love potion?

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.780
I'm not sure

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.880
whether it would be too sudden

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.960
to propose to Yu now.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.840
Don't worry, My Lord.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.680
I won't make you take responsibility.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.030
No.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.360
I can't rush into this.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.789
[Northern Inspection Division]

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.250
If I stay up late for a few more days,

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.850
I'll go bald.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.280
Good morning, Commander Li.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.960
Morning, Officer Huang.

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.870
-Why do you look like this too?
-Why do you look like this too?

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.190
Don't mention it. When I close my eyes,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.009
my mind is filled with...

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.400
Filled with what?

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.200
Chen Zhao's cause of death.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.130
We're all suffering.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.229
What about you?

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.430
Don't even ask.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.650
Last night, Mrs. Lu

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.250
made me tell stories all night long.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.080
Mrs. Lu?

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.950
Lord Lu's mother.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.110
Princess Zhaoyang.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.830
By the way,

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.040
Mrs. Lu asked me to give this to you.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.210
Commander Li.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.590
Why are you giving me a property deed?

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.240
You're not still planning
to marry me, are you?

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.940
Officer Huang, who are you
planning to marry?

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.050
My Lord, please don't misunderstand.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.860
Your mother asked me to give this to her.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.960
It's not mine.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.680
Why would my mother
give Huang Yu a property deed?

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.730
A month ago,

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.210
Mrs. Lu went to Guanyin Temple

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.320
to pray for your marriage.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.140
She fainted on her way home due to illness

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.970
and was later taken
to a clinic by Officer Huang.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.610
So she is Mrs. Lu.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.070
Mrs. Lu, to express her gratitude,

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.270
asked me to give you
this property deed.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.610
I don't think it's appropriate

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.860
for me to accept this.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.510
Since my mother gave it to you,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.640
just accept it.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.310
Then I'll take it.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.190
I have a house now!

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.530
She's so easily satisfied.

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.030
If I gave her all the Lu family's wealth,

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:22.579
I wonder

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.100
how happy she would be.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.100
I have a house now!

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.440
But anyway,

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.280
Zhao.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Are you that free?

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.340
You couldn't even come up
with the antidote after so long,

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.079
but you had all night

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.780
to chat with my parents?

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.520
Well...

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.160
Go.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.660
Horse stance at the training ground
for 6 hours.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.900
Six...

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.590
Okay.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.260
My Lord.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.120
Since I have my own house now,

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.780
I'll move out of your villa.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:14.640
Fine.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.860
But I should warn you,

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.800
that house
is in the west side of the city.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.920
If you go to work,

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.560
you'll have to walk

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.210
for at least 2 hours every day.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.650
Then forget it.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.220
Getting more sleep is more important.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.450
As you predicted, My Lord,

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.370
Lord Lu took Officer Huang
to the Chen Mansion

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.230
to conduct an autopsy last night.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.480
Then I can openly go to Yu now.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.720
There's one more thing.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.800
What is it?

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.130
This is a stone

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.760
I found in the jewelry box

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.720
Qiulan stole.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.480
I believe

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.610
this stone is quite extraordinary.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.240
I feel like I've seen
this stone somewhere before.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.820
Now Lu Zhan will
have to come begging to me.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.200
Yu.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.930
Look what I brought for you.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.570
Isn't Commander Li coming to eat?

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:49.970
He's busy.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.610
Try this.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.730
Take a bite.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.000
Delicious!

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.890
Eat slowly.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.510
No one's fighting you for it.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.710
It really is delicious.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.950
I've been careless in choosing friends.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.060
What's going on with Lu Sanliang?

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.690
Is he possessed?

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.409
Or has his soul been swapped?

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.820
Could it be the after-effects
of the love potion?

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.000
Lord Shen!

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.490
You're here for breakfast too?

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.890
That's right.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.550
He's like a persistent ghost.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.070
You should try this flatbread.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.780
It's especially crispy.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:50.590
And so tasty.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.550
Yu, you're so good.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.890
I knew I wasn't wasting
my affection on you.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:55.890
Give it to me.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.690
I bought this myself.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:59.800
If you want some,

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:00.760
go buy your own.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.570
I don't even care to eat it.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.720
I just enjoy watching Yu eat.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.310
Do you have other business?

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.500
If so, go take care of your business.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.280
I do have business.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.530
Did you find anything
at the Chen Mansion last night?

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:20.400
Yes.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.000
Chen Zhao's death
was indeed not an accident.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.130
He died from the deadly poison
called "Threads of Love."

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.600
I knew there was something suspicious
about Chen Zhao's death.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.650
Now that you know the results,

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:35.860
you can get lost.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.220
Well, Lord Lu, it seems you

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.550
don't want to know

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.240
where this stone came from.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.220
Weren't you just telling me to get lost?

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.710
What are your terms?

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.550
Let me hit you back.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.470
You can't fight back.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:01.740
Fine.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.020
Let's go.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.780
Then I'm going to start.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:34.970
My Lord!

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.260
Yu, why are you stopping me?

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.330
He is my superior after all.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.030
I can't just watch him get beaten up.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:44.800
Besides,

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.180
both of you gentlemen
are working for the court.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.580
There's no need for this.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:50.470
It seems that Lord Shen

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.430
is really narrow-minded,

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.580
making such a fuss over a small matter.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.820
Lu Sanliang, can you please shut up?

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.070
To protect you,

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.990
I've offended the God of Wealth himself.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:02.720
What if I insist on hitting him?

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.380
Go ahead.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:09.690
Forget it.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.000
Since Yu said so,

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.170
I'll let it go.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.370
What can I say? I'm just magnanimous.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.650
If you want to know the answer,

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.820
just follow me.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:35.960
Qiulan.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.390
Do you recognize this item?

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:40.620
I don't know, sir.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.610
I suggest you think carefully
before answering.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.860
Can't you question her properly?

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.220
Don't end up with nothing from her

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.750
while scaring her to death.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.840
Qiulan.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.140
Think again. You've seen this before.
