[A Mission of the Heart]

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:10.970
[Episode 10]

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.400
Qiulan.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.450
Think hard. You've seen it before.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.020
I'm trying.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.520
Just a moment, please.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.970
It's coming back to me now.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.530
I saw it in Ms. Liu's jewelry box.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.800
At that time,

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.890
she was muttering about it.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.180
Just a worthless stone like this

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.910
deserves to be kept carefully?

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.470
It clearly isn't anything valuable.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.910
What was Lord Chen thinking?

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.360
This Lord Chen

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.820
is Chen Zhao?

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.070
Yes.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.130
Could this be the thing
the mysterious man in black

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.660
was looking for last night?

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.860
It should be.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.220
One piece belongs to Wang Mang.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.630
The other one belongs to Chen Zhao.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.690
Wang Mang is the thief
who stole the relief funds.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.150
So this means

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.370
Chen Zhao was involved
in the relief fund theft case.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.250
It's just that we don't know

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.410
how many people are behind this.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.289
If that's the case,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.430
the person who snuck
into the Chen Mansion last night

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.410
is also involved
in the relief fund theft case?

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.610
Maybe he's the one who killed Chen Zhao.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.420
Why didn't you catch him then?

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.570
I...

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.680
He couldn't use his internal energy
at that time,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.340
because he was affected by...

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.759
Nothing.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.570
I didn't know that person's identity
at that time.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.500
I was afraid of alerting the enemy.

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.430
I just don't know

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.630
what the stone is actually used for.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.920
Is it a symbol of membership
in their organization?

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.150
No.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:09.810
If that were the case,

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.080
that person last night
wouldn't have needed to steal it.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.079
It looks like a key.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.520
A key?

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.530
This could be

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.690
a puzzle piece of a key to a treasure.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.760
I get it.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.170
They hid the stolen relief funds

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.290
in a very secret place.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.800
And each person

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.140
has a part of the key.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.570
To get the money,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.380
they must use all the key pieces

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.800
to open the door.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.110
That must be it.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.440
Unfortunately,

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.240
you lost the only clue last night.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.820
Now how are you going
to track down the mastermind behind this?

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.250
It's not impossible.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.400
Think about it.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.860
Everyone knows about the relationship
between Chen Zhao and Liu Mei'er.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:57.550
We only need

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.530
to subtly spread the news that this stone

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.490
is in Liu Mei'er's hands.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.600
The mastermind will reveal themselves.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.950
Yu, you're so smart.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.040
But

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.760
you two are too handsome and eye-catching.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.210
You've also been frequenting
Xiafeng House lately.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.130
You definitely
can't just walk in like this.

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:27.460
How do we get in then?

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.510
Mr. Li, we've been waiting for you!

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.380
Drink more!

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.360
We're almost there, Mr. Huang.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.200
The girl you asked for

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.520
is inside.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.540
Don't let anyone disturb us.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.190
I understand.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.680
Mr. Huang, enjoy yourself.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.680
I won't take up any more of your time.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.920
Alright, I'll reward both of you.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.120
I'll reward both of you.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.450
I'll reward both of you!

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.780
After him!

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.490
Damn it. We lost him.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.210
His lightness skill is incredible.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.140
Even with our combined effort,
we couldn't catch up.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.200
Forget it.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.980
Let's head back first.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.520
I have failed in my duty

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.330
to retrieve the Moon Stone.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.650
Please punish me, Master.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.300
Who has the Moon Stone now?

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.610
Lu Zhan.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.070
I'm afraid Wang Mang's Moon Stone

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.360
is also in his hands.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.590
I never expected that Lu Zhan would still

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.710
beat us to it.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.270
I will definitely get the Moon Stone back!

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.040
Do not act rashly.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.420
Lu Zhan is highly skilled in martial arts

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.020
and ruthless in his methods.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.520
If we make one wrong move,

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.040
he'll likely catch us out.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.510
We need to plan carefully.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.450
You should lie low for a while.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:13.740
Yes.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:39.520
Is it delicious, Yu?

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.270
Yes, it is!

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.890
Who eats such rich food for breakfast?

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.650
That's a total recipe for indigestion!

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.000
Looks like I prepared this for nothing.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.860
Some people just don't appreciate it.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.690
I think I might as well throw it away.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:02.580
No, My Lord!

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.630
It'd be such a waste

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.900
to throw this lavish meal away.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.580
I'll eat it!

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.220
What's going on with these two?

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.060
It's just a handkerchief.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.659
Is there really any need to fight over it?

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:45.960
My Lord.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.150
Someone found Zhang Chuchu's body

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.680
in the mass grave.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.090
What are you waiting for?

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.420
Let's hurry over there!

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.020
When was the body discovered?

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.550
A heavy rain the day before yesterday
caused a landslide.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.440
Zhang Chuchu's coffin was washed out.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.040
Someone found it this morning
and reported it.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.540
How awful.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.470
The deceased is Zhang Chuchu,

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.520
the top courtesan at Xiafeng House.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.300
She was around 23 years old.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.720
She has been dead for about 10 days.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.560
There are

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.620
multiple whip marks and binding wounds
on her body.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.240
This suggests that before her death,

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.970
she might have been imprisoned

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.260
and severely tortured.
