[A Mission of the Heart]

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.960
[Episode 11]

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.920
When was the body found?

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.350
The heavy rain two days ago
caused a landslide.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.290
Zhang Chuchu's coffin
was thus flushed out.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.940
It was discovered this morning
and reported to us.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.370
How unfortunate.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.360
The dead was named Zhang Chuchu,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.430
the former top courtesan at Xiafeng House.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.470
She was about 23 years old.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.700
It's been around 10 days since she died.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.500
There are

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.030
multiple whip and ligature marks on her.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.470
This means

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.660
she was probably confined

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.510
and tortured before she died.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.610
She most likely died from suffocation.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.710
Yu,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.560
what caused that bruise

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.890
on her neck?

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.460
About that...

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.099
I'm not sure yet.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.200
Zhao,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.720
bring the body to the division.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.730
Focus on investigating

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.520
those close to Zhang Chuchu,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.880
especially the males.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.410
Got it.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.570
-Yu!
-Yu!

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.400
Yu!

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.030
Zhao.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.310
Feel her pulse.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.900
How is she?

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.450
Is Yu seriously ill?

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:33.360
No.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:34.950
She just...

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.360
Just what?

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.440
She just ate too much food.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.130
What?

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.630
My Lord,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.930
what did Officer Huang eat this morning?

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.380
Meat. Why do you ask?

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:49.259
Meat?

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.979
That's the problem!

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.600
She ate so much greasy food

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.500
that her stomach has got upset.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.110
Officer Huang should really curb

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.020
her huge appetite.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.610
As the saying goes,
only those who eat moderately

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.550
would live long.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.050
If this continues,

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.340
she'll die from overeating one day.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.620
But, My Lords,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.970
why didn't you stop her?

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.199
Lord Shen,
anything wrong with your throat?

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.980
It was my fault.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.730
My Lord,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.950
you are indeed to blame for this matter.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.150
You must stop indulging Officer Huang.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.800
I made her eat that much.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.060
Lord Shen! Well...

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.570
I need to bring Zhang Chuchu's body

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.420
to the Northern Inspection Division.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.060
I may have to trouble you
to lead the horse.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.060
Thank you, My Lord.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.070
I can't believe this punk Li Zhaoxia

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.380
asked me to drive the carriage myself.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.640
I'm like a coachman for Lu Zhan now.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.860
Are you feeling better?

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.530
After Commander Li
performed acupuncture on me,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.280
I'm feeling much better now.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.910
I'm sorry.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.830
My Lord, that was not your fault.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.540
I shouldn't have eaten so much.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.040
From now on, you won't have to do

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.870
what you're reluctant to.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.760
Don't be in fear of offending me.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.130
Really?

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.620
But you'll get angry that way.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.650
I'll try not to.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.090
Okay.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.780
From now on,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.810
I'll try

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.030
declining what I don't feel like doing.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.720
My Lord, I know what caused that bruise.

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:46.890
It was a thumb ring.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.860
The thumb ring on Lord Chen's hand.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.280
Shen Pan, halt the carriage.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.320
What is it now?

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.829
Take care of Yu for the moment.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.500
I have urgent business to attend to.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.210
Fine.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:07.830
Watch the speed.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.900
Okay.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.750
I must bring Mao with me
next time I go out.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.720
God knows where that lad has gone.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.070
He always disappears at critical times.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.180
Where's the stuff I told you to look for?

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.880
Where is it now?

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.320
You'll get your payment!

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.700
Mrs. Chen.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.590
Sorry for the intrusion.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.720
We may need to open the casket
to examine Mr. Chen's body.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.340
You're crossing the line, Imperial Guards!

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.430
This is my husband's funeral.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.370
Can't you just let him

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.290
rest in peace?

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.930
We the Imperial Guards
are investigating a case.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.800
Those who dare to cause obstruction

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.800
will be executed.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.650
Zhao!

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:20.270
Yes.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.230
Open the casket.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.770
Yes.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.050
My Lord!

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.560
My Lord,

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.250
those works are about the love life
of me and my husband.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.370
I'm afraid
they're not proper reading for you.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.790
My Lord.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.090
The thumb ring on Chen Zhao's hand

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.490
matches the bruise on Zhang Chuchu's neck.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:06.700
What?

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.850
Mrs. Chen, you know that woman?

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.930
No, I don't.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.610
Tell the truth.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.300
My husband

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:17.750
once hid this woman

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.820
in his secret chamber.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.240
Take us there.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.060
How did you find out

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.140
your husband was hiding a woman here?

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.659
Previously,

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.820
my husband often got up
late at night and went out.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.320
He acted mysteriously.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.430
I thought he was cheating on me.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.880
So,

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.450
I followed him in secret.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.110
Tell me!

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.730
Where is the stuff hidden?

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.780
I really don't know.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:04.860
You don't know?

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.720
You and Wang Mang are lovers.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.460
How could you not know?

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.620
He only told me

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.870
that he'd take me away
once he made a fortune.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.510
Now that you know nothing,

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.570
you've outlived your usefulness.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.640
Out of fear of getting killed,

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.060
I dared not say a word about it

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.110
to outsiders.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:55.510
Zhao.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:56.790
Yes.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.130
Bring all these things

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.150
back to the Northern Inspection Division.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:00.650
Yes.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.020
Lord Shen,

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:07.890
I'm really fine now.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.480
You don't need to care for me
like this anymore.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.230
But I insist,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.720
until you fully recover.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.970
Have some more.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.460
My Lord,

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.710
I got a lead.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:19.780
What is it?

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.580
The killer of Chen Zhao

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.730
is among these men.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.960
Who is this?

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.990
This is Jia Fugui.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.450
He and Chen Zhao

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.300
once fought over Liu Mei'er.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.240
Chen Zhao kept bullying him.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.179
That makes him

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.039
a major suspect.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.240
Hold on!

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.059
Isn’t this Mr. Zhou,

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:42.260
who had a crush on Chuchu?

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.220
Yes.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:44.840
In fact,

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.200
he was stalking Chen Zhao the entire time.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.150
Looks like he's a major suspect too.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.370
I quietly followed
the Chen family's carriage.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.610
Then I saw them just toss Chuchu's body

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.290
at the mass grave.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.220
I dared not hold a grand funeral for her,

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.190
so I bought a fine coffin

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.720
and buried her in secret.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.580
Why didn't you report it
to the authorities?

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.540
Did you not know
Chuchu was a wanted criminal?

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.870
Back then, I only wanted to avenge Chuchu.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.690
I planned to kill Chen Zhao!

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.190
But I never

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.160
got a chance to do so at that time.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.540
Then, one day,

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.330
I found him drinking the Drunken Dream

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.190
for more pleasure in the brothel.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.330
So, I slipped poison

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.810
in this wine.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.980
Who gave you the Threads of Love?

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.130
I don't know that man's identity.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.460
The only thing I know
is that he wore a mask.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.180
Put the drug in this bottle

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.960

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.040
and you'll avenge Chuchu.
