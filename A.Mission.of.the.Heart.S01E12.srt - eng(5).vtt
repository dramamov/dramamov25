[A Mission of the Heart]

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:10.940
[Episode 12]

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.510
I wonder what this ghost-masked man

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.150
truly wants.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.380
Could he have something to do

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.110
with the disaster relief fund?

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.890
I don't know.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.620
Mr. Zhou

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.900
was also a pitiful man.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.070
In order to pursue Zhang Chuchu,

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.250
he spent all his savings.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.050
In the end,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.390
in order to avenge her,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.810
he even lost his own life.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.950
Young Lady.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.030
Young Lady,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.970
have we met somewhere before?

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.160
You... must have mistaken me
for someone else.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.120
No, Young Lady.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.820
I really think

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.040
you look very familiar.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.640
You've got the wrong person.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.530
-Young Lady.
-What are you doing?

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.030
What is wrong with...

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.020
Lord Lu.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.789
So it's Lord Jiang,
Vice Minister of Revenue.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.750
What?

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.450
Interested in my subordinate?

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.480
You're old.

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:22.700
Surely you aren't thinking
of snatching a young lady, right?

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.500
Lord Shen,

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.820
don't talk nonsense.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.100
I merely thought

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.720
her eyes and brows
resemble those of an old friend

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.650
and wanted to ask who her father is.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.560
Asking about her father?

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.530
Trying to make connections?

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.160
Not at all.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.350
Since you're not trying
to make connections,

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.470
why ask about her father?

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.509
I am a third-rank official.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.360
What would I do to a young lady?

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.650
You'd better not.

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:50.690
I have important matters to attend to.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.750
I should get going.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.250
Let's go.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.090
See you, Lord Jiang.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.160
Yu.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.540
You know Jiang Ning?

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.960
No.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.810
Then why are you afraid of him?

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.140
I don't know why

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.579
I'd recall

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.600
some very frightening scenes

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.770
whenever I see him.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.140
But my memories are very blurry.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.680
I can't remember clearly.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.420
By the way, Officer Huang,

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.090
where's your family?

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.520
How come
I've never heard you mention them?

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.540
I don't remember.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.220
I have no memories before the age of 5.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.400
Then how did you grow up?

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.960
What's wrong?

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.920
When I was 5,

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.570
my father found me,
who was still breathing,

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.300
at a mass grave. So he took me in.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.940
And then,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.240
he taught me
how to perform autopsies and read.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.020
No wonder you're so skilled at autopsies.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.520
I didn't expect you to start learning
at such a young age.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.650
Your father must be very capable then.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.840
Can you introduce me to him?

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.600
Hey, Mao.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.260
I want...

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.600
What are you doing?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.000
I want to go to the toilet.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.630
I want to go to the toilet.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.310
You, a grown man, still need someone

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.840
to go to the toilet with you?

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.980
I'm sorry, Yu.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.510
Mao...

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.360
doesn't know your background.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.630
It's fine.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.190
Don't worry.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.890
Aren't I perfectly fine?

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.690
Delicious.

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.090
-Don't eat too much.
-Don't eat too much.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.440
Are you scared?

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.140
No.

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:34.540
Yu.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.409
Did your adoptive father...
treat you well?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.600
My father was very good to me.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.330
But when I was 15,

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.590
he passed away due to an illness.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.270
After that...

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.310
I was all alone.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.140
Then... did anyone bully you?

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.120
You little brat.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.160
What are you talking about?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.460
With my great strength,

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.760
how could anyone bully me?

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.090
They were lucky
that I didn't beat them up.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.470
Our Yu is the most formidable.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.140
These are the names

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.170
of those who bullied Officer Huang.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.170
Yu has immense strength.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.760
How could she be bullied?

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.640
Since ancient times,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.020
commoners don't fight against officials.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.830
Although Officer Huang has great strength,

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.550
she is still just an ordinary person.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.080
How can she fight
against the powerful and noble?

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.410
She can fight back once,

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.210
but she can't do so every time.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.560
The people on this list—

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.220
don't let them live too comfortably.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.220
From now on...

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:37.990
if anyone dares to bully you,

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.310
I'll help you punish them severely.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.270
What's wrong?

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.840
Nothing.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.200
What does Lu Sanliang

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.410
mean by this?

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.430
At least he could have put me down
before leaving!

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.740
How was the relationship

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.860
between your madam

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.260
and your master usually?

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.900
Before Madam became pregnant,

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.390
they were always on good terms.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.950
Later, after Madam became pregnant,

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.680
their relationship worsened.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.660
She became emotionally unstable

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.320
and often argued with Master.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.720
Then Master grew weary of it

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.310
and rarely came home.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.480
How did your madam

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.300
dress usually?

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.200
During the daytime,

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.330
when we saw Madam,

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.070
she always dressed plainly.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.590
[Daily Journal]

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.030
Do you recognize the handwriting on this?

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.000
This is Madam's handwriting.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:10.100
Are you certain?

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:11.790
Usually, when Madam wrote or painted,

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.520
it was always me who served her.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.000
Zhao.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.160
Yes.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.560
Take Mrs. Chen's previous calligraphy
and paintings

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.820
and this suicide note,

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.670
and give them all to Shen Pan.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.070
He has considerable expertise
in calligraphy and paintings.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.070
He should be able to find something.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:27.780
What's wrong?

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.780
Just say it.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.370
Was what happened yesterday...

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.400
too much of a blow

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.570
to Officer Huang?

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.669
This morning, I didn't see her at all.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:35.990
Crap.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:37.370
Yu!

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.590
Yu?

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.740
Yu!

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:52.100
Yu.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:52.930
Yu.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.280
Are you okay?

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.390
What do you think?

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.350
I'm sorry, Yu.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.560
You still remember me?

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.360
I'll take you back to rest first.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.040
You must have been freezing all night
last night.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.040
What do you think?

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.770
It was all thanks to you.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.270
I endured cold wind all night

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:20.830
and fell flat on my face.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.750
I'm sorry.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.830
I'll never do that again.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.010
Alright.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:30.470
You can put me down now.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.200
I'm not that badly hurt.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.750
I'll forgive you this time.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:34.870
Really?

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:44.880
By the way,

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.970
who was that person last night?

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.040
Did you catch him?

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.270
No.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.310
Again?

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:53.770
My Lord,

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.260
your ability to catch people

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.720
doesn't seem very reliable.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.250
What do you mean by "again"?

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.240
Are you doubting my capability?

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:01.700
No.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.880
It was the ghost-masked man.
