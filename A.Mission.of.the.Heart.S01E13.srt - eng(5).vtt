[A Mission of the Heart]

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:10.980
[Episode 13]

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.900
By the way,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.860
who was that person last night?

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.080
Did you catch them?

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.310
No.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.710
Failed again?

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.840
My Lord,

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.250
your ability to catch people

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.680
doesn't seem all that impressive.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.390
What do you mean "failed again"?

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.320
Are you questioning my abilities?

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.870
Not at all.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.250
It was the ghost-masked man.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.310
He deliberately led me
to the Chen Mansion.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.570
The ghost-masked man?

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.030
What was he doing at the Chen Mansion?

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.290
Something happened to Mrs. Chen?

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.290
Mrs. Chen is dead.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.570
Dead?

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.680
What's the cause of death?

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.810
Not yet determined.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.700
Alright,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.080
I'll get my tools and investigate.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.280
Are you well enough to go?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.980
This little cold is nothing.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.140
Besides,

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.800
what matters most now
is to find out the truth.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.580
Let's go.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.000
Good morning, Lord Shen.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.280
Commander Li.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.620
What brings you here

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:10.930
in the early morning?

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.840
Why did your lord

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.110
give me a bunch
of calligraphy and paintings?

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.100
For investigation.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.100
What case?

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.039
Mrs. Chen hanged herself
at home last night.

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.310
My lord is confused about this

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.840
and has sent me
to consult with you, Lord Shen.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.360
Mrs. Chen is dead?

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.130
Yes.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.550
My lord also said

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.590
that in the art
of calligraphy and painting,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.120
your mastery is unmatched.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.840
He believes you will surely
be able to determine

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.840
whether this suicide note

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.410
was personally written by Mrs. Chen.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.910
That goes without saying.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.420
In calligraphy and painting,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.210
none can rival my lord.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.150
Indeed.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.360
Lu Zhan is finally
getting to act like a person.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.390
Leave it here.

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.890
I'll provide my findings soon.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:56.880
Commander Li,

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.310
do you have any other questions?

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:00.230
No.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.630
I'll take my leave now.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.780
I won't see you out.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.400
I thought I'd need to do more convincing.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.370
I didn't expect Lord Shen

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.449
agreed so soon.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.520
Epidermal abrasion at the ligature mark.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.829
Hemorrhage in the skin tissue.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.290
Bruising on the neck.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.990
Fracture of the greater cornu
of the hyoid bone

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.770
with associated hemorrhage.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.630
What's the result?

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.290
Based on the autopsy results,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.100
Mrs. Chen did indeed
die from strangulation.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.030
Strangulation?

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.620
Strange.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.850
Did I miss something?

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.040
No hurry.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.330
Take your time.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.750
Officer Huo.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.360
Yes.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.650
Secure the scene.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.690
Without my order,

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.390
no one is allowed to approach this area.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.890
Also,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.850
when Commander Li returns,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.480
tell him to come to the villa.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.720
Say I have urgent business with him.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.440
Yes, sir.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.579
Let's go.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.230
My Lord!

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.110
My Lord.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.960
My Lord.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.960
My Lord.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.960
Officer Huo

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.660
said you needed me urgently.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.290
Come check Yu's pulse.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.490
There's really nothing serious.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.630
I'll just brew some ginger tea

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.160
and drink some, that'll do.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:42.390
Zhao.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.250
How is she?

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.030
She's fine.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.710
Some brown sugar ginger tea
will warm her up

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.110
and make her feel better.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.410
My Lord.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.390
This is your urgent matter?

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:03.950
Anything concerning Yu

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:04.950
is never trivial.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.710
Yu.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.750
Do you have brown sugar
and ginger at home?

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.440
Yes.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.240
Good.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.400
By the way,

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.280
Zhao,

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.380
the roof seems to be damaged.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.399
Go check it now.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.779
Yes, sir.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.680
I, a dignified Imperial Guard,

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.460
ended up

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.240
repairing the roof.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.420
It seems our lord

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.070
is really obsessed.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.270
Lord Shen.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.040
What brings you here?

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.720
We heard that Officer Huang is sick.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.409
We came specifically to see her.

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:49.220
What's wrong?

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.430
Are we not welcome?

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.870
That's not what I meant.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.920
It's just that

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.450
you've come at an inconvenient time.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.080
But Lord Shen,

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.000
I didn't mean that, either.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.940
But now

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.720
my lord is taking care of Officer Huang.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.550
You can rest assured, Lord Shen.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.760
Your lord?

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.470
That King of Hell

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.190
can take care of others?

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.190
Who said I don't know
how to take care of people?

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.030
Oh, it's you, Lord Shen.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.140
You worry too much, Lord Shen.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.600
I will take good care of Yu.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.750
Zhao.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.020
See him out.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.300
Excuse me, Lord Shen.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:25.640
It's fine.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.140
As long as Yu is safe.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.690
Commander Li, what are you doing?

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:33.370
Last night,

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.390
our lord
and Officer Huang did something,

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.760
I don't even know what,

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.840
and ended up poking a hole in the roof.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.890
So I was sent to fix it.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:43.760
I see.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.290
Then I'll have Mao stay and help you.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.640
Let me tell you,

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.690
I won't help you with manual labor.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.050
After my lord

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.610
marries Officer Huang,

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.450
tasks like building roofs and fixing beds

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.600
will be my responsibility.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.800
I can't trouble

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.160
outsiders like you.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:08.850
Your lord

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.250
will marry Officer Huang?

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.310
Is there a problem?

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.310
Of course there's a problem.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.250
If they are married,

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.600
what about my lord?

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.720
The one who will marry Officer Huang

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.640
will definitely be my lord.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.880
My lord.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.830
My lord.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:22.760
My lord.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:23.750
My lord!

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:24.950
My lord!

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.390
My lord!

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.290
My lord is handsome and elegant.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.090
Your lord is a fair-faced Asura.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.730
Your lord is a ladies' man.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.900
My lord is loyal and devoted.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:34.909
Surrounded by beauties,

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:36.690
my lord's heart remains still.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:37.600
Among countless choices,

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.520
my lord's heart belongs to only one.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.290
My lord is charming and elegant.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.620
My lord is highly skilled in martial arts.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:45.920
My lord...

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.720
My lord...

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.490
Your lord has already gone far away.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.460
My Lord!

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.040
Alright.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.740
-My Lord!
-Your lord. Your lord.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.650
-Alright. Don’t cry.
-My Lord!

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.780
Fine, your lord...

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.150
Your lord is good.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.280
It's my lord who is good.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.810
Right.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.590
My lord is good.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.600
My Lord!

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.890
My Lord!

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.510
Mao!

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:19.280
Mao!

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:20.790
Help me!

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:28.750
My Lord.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.050
I'd rather drink it myself.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.980
Zhao.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.490
Turn around.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.480
Deceiving yourself.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.950
My Lord.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.150
What did you find out about Mrs. Chen?

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.360
I've figured it out.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.740
Not long ago, Mrs. Chen

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.200
had quite a few new clothes made

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.720
for her unborn child.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:56.930
When?

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.850
The day after Chen Zhao's death.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.540
The day after Chen Zhao's death?

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.440
I know what I missed.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.510
My Lord, I'm going to the morgue.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.570
I'll be right back.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.640
Zhao.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:22.550
My Lord.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.280
What would you like me to do?

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.370
My Lord!

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.280
I was wrong.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.710
I shouldn't have

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:31.680
told the truth.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.000
But it's not a crime worthy of death!

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.419
My Lord, please spare me.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:36.860
Stop talking nonsense.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.610
Who said anything about dying?

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:39.590
I want you to simulate

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.049
Mrs. Chen's death.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:11.920
Again.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:13.090
What?

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.160
What are you waiting for? Again.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.250
[As a mother, I failed to protect
the child in my womb.]

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:09.830
[I have brought shame
upon the ancestors of the Chen family,]

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:10.420
[and only by death
can I atone for my sin.]

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:14.560
The force is wrong.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.190
Zhao.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:20.710
One more time.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.660
Again?

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:39.260
My Lord.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.770
Is this good enough now?

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.950
Lu Zhan, what are you doing?

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.470
Testing.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:50.870
Zhao and I

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:52.470
repeatedly tested it.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.040
If someone kicked over their own stool,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.730
under no circumstances

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.840
would it end up here.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.230
This means

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.000
someone deliberately
staged the hanging scene.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.760
I agree with your theory.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.310
Because that suicide note

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.640
was not made by Mrs. Chen.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.030
To imitate it so perfectly,

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.170
the person must be skilled at forgery

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:14.260
and

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.230
familiar with Mrs. Chen's habits.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.380
But Officer Huang said

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.930
Mrs. Chen hanged herself.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.170
It was indeed a hanging suicide.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.590
But it wasn't voluntary.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:27.920
What do you mean by that?

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Because of this.
