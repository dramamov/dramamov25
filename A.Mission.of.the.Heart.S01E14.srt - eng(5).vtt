[A Mission of the Heart]

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:10.970
[Episode 14]

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.470
Because of this.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.230
Look at this.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.250
This is the wood splinter I found

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.120
on the back of her head
during the second autopsy.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.120
It matches the splinter
found at the crime scene.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.070
Is it possible

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.150
that the killer pushed Mrs. Chen down

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.620
in a confrontation,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.250
causing her
to lose consciousness, miscarry,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.470
and eventually die?

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.000
In other words,

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.150
the killer mistakenly thought
Mrs. Chen was already dead,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.430
feared being held accountable
for the crime,

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.190
and simply staged

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.520
a fake scene of Mrs. Chen hanging herself.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.370
Since we've concluded it's a homicide,

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.160
we need to track down the mastermind
behind this.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.820
Don't you think

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.770
Mrs. Chen's clothing

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.930
was too flamboyant?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.030
Indeed.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.780
Let's not even talk
about wearing mourning clothes.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.510
Since Lord Chen had just passed away,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.180
her clothes were way too ostentatious.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.230
Maybe

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.220
Mrs. Chen didn't like Chen Zhao.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.010
Why?

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:16.930
I have found out

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.020
that Chen Zhao injured his genitals
in his early years,

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.360
which left him infertile.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.640
So the child Mrs. Chen was carrying

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.630
was most likely not Chen Zhao's.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.440
What?

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.660
No wonder he had to rely on medicine

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.520
to boost his performance in the bedroom.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.190
By the way,

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.930
a maid from the Chen Mansion once said...

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.560
Before Madam got pregnant,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.500
she was in good health all the time.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.870
But after she became pregnant,

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.310
her health took a turn for the worse.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.440
So that means

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.720
Chen Zhao actually knew

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.380
the child Mrs. Chen was carrying
wasn't his own.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.690
It seems that Mrs. Chen

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.600
often met her lover secretly at night.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.870
Chen Zhao was also quite strange.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.550
The child wasn't even his,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.229
so why didn't he force Mrs. Chen

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.789
to end the pregnancy

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.100
and divorce her?

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.570
At the very least,

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.190
he should have sought revenge
against the child's real father, right?

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.510
Not necessarily.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.140
What if he wanted this child

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.460
and thus hid the truth?

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.600
Impossible.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.000
Chen Zhao was narrow-minded.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.210
He was a two-faced scoundrel.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.170
He would do anything for his own benefit.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.100
There was no way
he would raise someone else's child.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.320
I mean

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.750
he was a petty man

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.630
and would only raise the child

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.760
for his own benefit.

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.829
So you're saying

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.880
Mrs. Chen's lover

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.890
holds a higher official rank
than Chen Zhao?

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.170
It is possible.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.320
Then that means

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.240
the killer
is likely a high-ranking official.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.750
The two must have gotten
into some kind of dispute,

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.800
and he killed Mrs. Chen by accident.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.800
How did you find out
about Mrs. Chen's death?

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.970
The ghost-masked man led me there.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.660
The ghost-masked man again?

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.060
Why is he everywhere?

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.240
What on earth does he want?

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.079
He probably intended to use me

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.360
to take down the one who killed Mrs. Chen.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.740
This ghost-masked man

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.260
likes using others to kill so much.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.990
Is he doing justice for heaven?

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.830
I just have a feeling

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.940
that this isn't as simple as it seems.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.660
Zhao.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.670
Yes.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.270
Mao.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.670
Yes.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.830
You two go ask around

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.750
and find out which officials

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.430
were on good terms

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.170
with Chen Zhao and his wife.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.410
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.450
Why did you kill Mrs. Chen?

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.960
Let's not even talk
about losing our cash cow.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.690
Aren't you afraid
Lu Zhan will trace it back to us?

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.920
I had no choice.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.920
She was threatening me
with the account book.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.750
I lost my grip for a moment

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.440
and killed her by mistake.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.000
But don't worry, My Lord.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.800
I was careful.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.340
Lu Zhan and the others
will never trace it to us.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.750
It had better be so.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.360
Have you found Mrs. Chen's

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.590
account book?

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.670
Not yet.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.320
But

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.990
it seems Lu Zhan and the others

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.100
haven't found out
about the account book yet.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.690
We must not let Lu Zhan
find that account book.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.000
Lu Zhan already knows
about the Moon Stone.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.550
If the account book
falls into his hands,

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.170
neither of us will be able

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.680
to keep our official positions.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.520
Yes.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.130
I'll handle it right away.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.420
Black Hawk.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:22.580
At your service.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.740
Keep a close eye on him.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.130
If he's exposed,

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.280
kill him.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.230
[Northern Inspection Division]

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.550
Commander Li.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.700
It seems
that your martial arts are impressive.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.780
Of course.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.870
Then your lightness skill
must be good too, right?

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.000
How about you teach me that?

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.760
This might not be appropriate.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.470
I won't let you teach me for nothing.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.860
How about this?

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.680
I'll give you at least one tael
of silver per month.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.950
Two taels. That's my final offer.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:11.870
Deal.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.260
Lift your legs higher!

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.500
Lift your legs higher.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.330
Higher!

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.270
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.900
Commander Li, you really are ruthless.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.160
Only under a strict master
can a disciple excel.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.270
This is just the beginning.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.740
Alright, alright.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.590
Higher.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.840
My Lord.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:31.790
My Lord.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.260
What are you doing?

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.350
I'm practicing my lightness skill.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.530
What's the point of practicing that?

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.800
It's tiring and difficult.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.720
Wherever you want to go,

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.190
I'll just take you.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.120
That won't do.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.280
I prefer to rely on myself.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.600
I don't like troubling others.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.600
Don't disturb me.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.520
Hold steady!

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.060
So slow!

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.990
Good.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.510
This one is good.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.790
Good. Hold still.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.070
Yu wants to learn the lightness skill.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.150
Why doesn't she ask you or me?

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.760
She can ask whoever she likes.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.200
I don't have any right to interfere.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.570
Since when have you been so generous?

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.030
I've always been this way.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.870
Well,

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.770
why are you here instead of handling cases

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.350
at the Ministry of Punishments?

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.950
You're doing the same thing.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.510
It's like the pot
calling the kettle black.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.850
Straighten your back! Straighten it!

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.710
Straighten it.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:33.400
Lift them up.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.970
Hold steady.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.770
Don't move! Don't move!

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.580
-Li Zhaoxia!
-Li Zhaoxia!

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.130
Hold the position.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.159
Commander Li is truly annoying.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.020
Indeed.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:57.750
-Yu!
-Yu!

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:00.830
Yu, are you alright?

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.910
I'm fine.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:04.840
Commander Li, your hands

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.210
are really beautiful.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.240
I'm even tempted to chop them off
for my own collection.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.090
No, no, no.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.470
I prefer collecting whole corpses.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.540
My Lords, please stop joking.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.160
Officer Huang,

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.860
I just remembered I have things to do.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.650
I can't teach you anymore.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.370
I'll refund your money later.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:21.940
I'm leaving now.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:22.900
Commander Li,

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.910
you promised to teach me!

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:25.490
Yu,

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.410
Commander Li is very busy.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.160
It's normal that he doesn't have time
to teach you.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:29.970
Exactly.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.460
He's not the only one
who knows the lightness skill.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.390
You can just find another teacher.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:35.750
That's true.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.490
Then I'll just find another teacher.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.370
Lord Shen, do you

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:44.590
have time to teach me?

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:45.720
He doesn't have time.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.950
I have time.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:48.500
Since when do you have time?

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.350
Then you can teach me, Lord Shen.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.590
It would be my honor to teach you, Yu.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:07.830
This way.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.470
Straighten your arm.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.050
Yes.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.270
Don't shake.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:13.870
Okay, I won't.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.270
It's all right. I'm here.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:16.390
I'm letting go now.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:18.790
This leg.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.460
Come on, straighten it.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:23.960
Be careful.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:25.690
That's right!

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.750
Shen Pan is such a sly bastard.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.660
He clearly did that on purpose!

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.660
My Lord, please calm down.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.150
Let's think this through.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:35.350
Come on, hold steady.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:36.370
I won't fall.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.159
It seems

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:38.809
Yu is still angry with me.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:39.880
Zhao,

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:41.730
give me some ideas.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.799
My Lord,

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.320
why did you have to give her
the cold shoulder

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:44.920
all night?

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.520
You were so close to winning her over,

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.690
but you let Shen Pan steal your chance.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.550
Li Zhaoxia,

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.480
I asked you to give me advice,

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.210
not to pick at my faults here!

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.890
Yes, yes. Let me think.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.670
Is this good?

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.230
Well done, Yu.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:03.960
What should you do?

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.590
Have you thought of any good ideas?

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.350
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.010
What on earth should you do?

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.960
Like this.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.870
Yes.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.650
I've got it!

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:16.990
Good, hold steady.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:17.730
What is it?

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:21.810
Very good.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.360
So many valuables.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.090
My Lord.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:35.810
All these are...

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.310
An apology.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.030
An apology?

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:42.920
Yu,

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.410
you're

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.030
not still angry, are you?

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.980
Angry? My Lord,

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.320
I'm not that kind of petty

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.800
or narrow-minded person.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.010
My Lord,

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:56.420
you know me so well.
