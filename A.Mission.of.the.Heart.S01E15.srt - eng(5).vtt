[A Mission of the Heart]

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.910
[Episode 15]

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.700
My Lord?

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.490
What are you doing here?

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.990
Zhao.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.440
Zhao.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.770
Yu kissed me.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.410
Kiss?

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.570
Great news!

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.120
Terrific.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.760
What did I tell you?

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.050
Yu definitely has a place for me
in her heart.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.980
Yes. That's what I've been saying.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.700
She must have feelings for you.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.730
She likes me.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.330
Yes!

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.890
That's right.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.680
Zhao.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.740
Do some martial practice with me.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.759
My Lord,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.380
it's already midnight.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.090
It's quite late.
Let's get back in for some rest.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.200
Why the rush?

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.130
It's only midnight.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.740
We've got much time.

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.300
Freeze!

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.450
Lord Shen is holding an umbrella
for Officer Huang.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.890
How thoughtful.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.120
So romantic.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.290
Using an umbrella in broad daylight...
Seems shady.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.880
Something's off with him.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.190
Lord Shen,

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.440
aren't we already good friends?

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.320
No need to go to all this trouble.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.250
How come...

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.090
Why is your son such a simpleton?

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.590
After taking the drug,

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.470
he still failed to win this girl over.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.090
He could've secured a wife for himself.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.740
Now,
another guy is about to steal her away.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.140
You're right. He's such a disappointment.

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:23.950
Lord Shen,

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.370
thank you
for teaching me lightness skills.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.829
Eat up. It's my treat today.

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:27.690
Help yourself.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.850
It looks like you've made a fortune, Yu.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.340
Lord Lu gave me a handsome reward.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.360
Really?

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.030
I'll enjoy this feast then.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.940
Is it good, Yu?

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.040
Yes, very tasty.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:51.940
Let me try this.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.900
Delicious!

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.380
My Lord,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.520
won't you go over there

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.090
to beat up Lord Shen?

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.420
Why would I do that?

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.790
Do I look like a petty man?

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.750
You coward!

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.610
Who is it?

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.800
Mother.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.880
Father.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.040
What brings you here?

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.450
Come on, sit down.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.320
Mr. Lu, Mrs. Lu.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.399
I had to come

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.660
to make sure I'll have a daughter-in-law.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.270
Finally, there's a girl
who can handle having you around.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.950
If Shen Pan steals her away,

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.310
I'll be devastated, won't I?

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.920
Honey,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.150
our son

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.010
is not as terrible as you said.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.390
He's adored by many girls.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:40.840
Shut up.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.330
Mother,

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.830
I can deal with this.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.690
You've never even held hands with a girl.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.120
How are you able to deal with this?

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.670
I...

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.010
Isn't that Shen Pan's close female friend?

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.450
I have an idea.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:54.720
Mother,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.970
I've worked out a solution.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.880
Nonetheless,

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.200
I need your help to put on a little show.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.760
Did you enjoy it, Yu? Was it good?

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:05.710
Lord Shen!

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.180
Ms. Su?

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.740
I have a favor to ask you.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.110
Will you lend me a helping hand,
Lord Shen?

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.690
Well...

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.340
Lord Shen, attend to your matters first.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.870
Mine are not urgent anyway.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.870
I happen to need to go to
the Northern Inspection Division.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.130
I'll take my leave now.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.570
Yu...

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.420
Lord Shen.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.960
What's the matter?

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.020
Let's talk inside.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.850
Son,

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.520
if you put in some effort,

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.510
you won't have trouble finding a wife.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.490
Exactly.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.710
No other girls are like Yu.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.860
Why should I bother courting them?

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.350
Madam!

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:00.570
Are you alright?

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.930
Shall I take you to a clinic?

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.280
I'm all fine, miss.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.250
Oh, it's you, Yu.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.340
You are...

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.660
Mrs. Lu!

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.770
Don't call me "Mrs. Lu."

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.590
Call me "Auntie" instead.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.220
Auntie...

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.230
Thank you, Auntie!

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.350
What are you thanking me for?

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.970
The deed
that you asked Commander Li

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.430
to deliver to me last time.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.170
I'm the one owing you thanks
for saving my life.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.210
Listen,

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.490
we the Lu family are very wealthy.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.610
I would've offered you an entire vault,

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.010
if it hadn't been for the fear
of drawing unwanted attention.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.750
An entire vault would be too much.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:42.870
Oh, right, Yu,

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:44.120
as it happens,

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.430
I'm going to Changsheng Temple
in Feng Mountain to make prayers.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:47.190
Would you

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.310
keep me company, if you have time?

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.240
I...

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.670
What a poor thing I am!

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.020
Though my life is financially comfortable,

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.690
my husband and son

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.980
are busy working all day long.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.020
They never have time for me.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.800
There isn't even a person I can talk to.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.230
See, now,
I have to go make prayers in a temple

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.930
all by my lonesome...

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.860
Auntie,

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.470
I'll go with you.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.810
Is it true?

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:20.890
That's great!

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:22.330
Let's hurry.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.680
If we miss the time for offering incense,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.410
our prayers won't be answered.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:27.330
Tell me.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.950
What can I help you with?

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:30.480
No need for this.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.780
I implore you, Lord Shen,

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.150
to have some people look for my sister.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.260
What happened to your sister?

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.700
She went missing.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.090
Let's go.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.040
My Lord?

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:46.870
Auntie...

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:48.760
Yu,

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.310
it has just occurred to me
that I need to be home for some matters.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.170
I can't go offer incense with you.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.659
But Zhan will keep you company.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.140
Remember to offer

00:07:57.159 --> 00:07:58.890
plenty of incense on my behalf.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.190
Let's go.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.210
Yu.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:29.620
Come on.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.370
I'll carry you on my back.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.480
No need, My Lord. I can walk on my own.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.630
Just get on my back.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.220
Yu.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.260
In fact, I arranged for all this.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.320
What do you mean?

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.150
I had Shen Pan distracted

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.680
and asked my mother
to invite you for this trip,

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.890
so that I could

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.390
meet with you.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:07.570
But

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.080
didn't we just see each other yesterday?

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.760
It was not the same, was it?

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.140
I don't want you

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.840
to get too close to Shen Pan.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.260
My Lord,

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.730
Lord Shen is just a friend of mine.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.060
But you asked him,
instead of me, to teach you

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.120
lightness skills.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:26.440
I didn't ask you

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.580
because I feared we might get into fights.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.790
Zhao,

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.760
turn back.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:48.040
Mrs. Lu,

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:49.890
it's not a good idea, is it?

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.590
If Lord Lu knows

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.910
we tail and watch him from behind,

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.430
I'll be punished.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.460
Don't worry. He wouldn't dare.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:57.900
Just do as I say.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.160
Yes.
