[A Mission of the Heart]

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.000
[Episode 16]

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.820
My Lord,

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.320
Lord Shen and I are just friends.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.600
Then why did you ask him, instead of me,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.330
to teach you lightness skills?

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.150
That's because...

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.440
I was worried we might argue.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.190
Why were you worried?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.040
First,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.000
you are a very serious person, My Lord.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.820
Whether dealing with people or matters,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.470
you are meticulous and strict.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.780
And I'm rather slow-witted.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.980
If you were harsh while teaching me,

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.890
I would surely curse you in my heart.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.080
From the sound of it,

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.370
you must've cursed me in your heart
quite often, haven't you?

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.540
Not really.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.160
You were mean and deceived me before.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.080
And you were so stingy.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.310
Fine.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.890
It's all my fault.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.760
Then...

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:20.570
do you still dislike me now?

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:26.890
No.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.160
It's precisely because
I don't dislike you...

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.020
that I didn't want you to teach me.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.390
Why?

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.720
I was worried you'd despise me.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.800
Yu,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.050
by nature, I am aloof and detached.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.180
My sole ambition was to make contributions
and build a career.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.440
I never liked getting too close to women.

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.440
Until you appeared.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.479
You are the one I love.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.800
I can't cherish you enough.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.520
How could I possibly despise you?

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.110
My Lord.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.860
Who said Lord Lu

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.250
doesn't know how to be romantic?

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.510
The sweet words he said

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.740
are not worse than those Lord Shen said.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.290
He's worthy of being my son.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.930
Just seize this opportunity

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.260
and take Yu back
to the Lu family directly.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.090
Help.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.880
Help me!

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:31.930
Let's go take a look.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:32.760
What's wrong?

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.070
Let's go.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.740
Young Lady.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.460
Young Lady!

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.270
Zhao!

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.460
Check on her.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.490
She's not going to make it.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.300
It's already a miracle

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.829
that she's made it this far.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.020
What about the baby?

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.460
Ziling!

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:53.920
It's Ziling!

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.930
Wake up! Look at me!

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.460
Look at me!

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.580
Which heartless bastard

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.960
did this to a pregnant woman?

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.060
Ziling.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.230
Su Ziling's wrists and ankles

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.030
show signs of having been bound.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.920
It's highly likely she was kidnapped...

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.170
or imprisoned.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.530
She accidentally fell off the cliff
while escaping.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.370
Judging from the chaotic footprints
at the scene,

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.960
there were at least 3 perpetrators.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.220
But Su Ziling and her husband's family

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.960
are not wealthy people.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.880
Even if the perpetrators kidnap them,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.630
they can't get much ransom.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.650
What could possibly be the reason

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:41.600
that would make these people

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.760
kidnap a pregnant woman?

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.600
Yu.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.120
Let me try.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.770
This place can hide someone?

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.590
Let's split up and search.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.900
See if there are any other clues

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.500
or mechanisms or something.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.500
There's nothing here.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.840
Su Ziling and the others

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.550
couldn't have appeared out of nowhere.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.210
Let's go back first

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.630
and see if we can

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.180
get any clues from Su Ziyan.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.560
My Lord!

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:44.040
There's a clue here!

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.530
This footprint looks very familiar.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.350
It's the same as the footprint

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.150
of the man in black
at Xiafeng House that night.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.960
Yu.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.180
Where's the dagger
left by the man in black

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.020
that day?

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:01.660
It's at my place.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.070
Bring it and go somewhere with me.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.080
Take me with you!

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.710
Yu.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.150
Go check Wang Mang's body

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.140
and see if there are any wounds
caused by this knife.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.920
My Lord,

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.060
the knife wounds on Wang Mang's body

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.970
were indeed caused by this curved knife.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:47.950
Just as I thought.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.180
Could it be...

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:50.670
that Wang Mang's death

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.770
is also related to the man in black?

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.520
When I was chasing Wang Mang,

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.220
a man bumped into him.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.390
I didn't pay much attention at the time.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.690
After Wang Mang died from poisoning,

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:01.930
I became suspicious.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.120
But I never found any leads.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.320
Now we finally have some clues.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.860
You mean...

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.250
Su Ziling's death?

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.320
But Wang Mang and the man in black

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.050
are both related
to the disaster relief fund robbery case.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.330
What about Su Ziling?

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.840
Was she also involved?

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.880
Zhao probably has some leads by now.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.550
Let's go back and check first.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.820
Let's go.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.900
I asked around.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:31.970
Currently in the city,

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:33.409
there are many pregnant women

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:35.470
like Su Ziling who have gone missing.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.120
Why specifically target

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.280
pregnant women?

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.720
Could it be...

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.420
for the babies in their wombs?

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.540
But their targets

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.220
all have something in common.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.040
First,

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.380
they are ordinary people

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.320
without status or powerful backgrounds.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.950
Second,

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.280
they are women despised by their husbands

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.290
and asking for secret remedies everywhere

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.350
because they couldn't get pregnant.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:56.200
Third,

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.610
they all visited Changsheng Temple.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:59.770
Mrs. Lu told me

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.370
about Changsheng Temple.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.260
Many couples who can't have children

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.120
would go there.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.960
Women who have been there
would get pregnant.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.350
No wonder Mother asked us
to go to Changsheng Temple.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.330
Changsheng Temple is more effective
than the Child-Giving Guanyin?

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.910
It can actually make these women

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.210
pregnant?

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.000
There must be something fishy about this.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.070
Ziyan said

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.220
that her younger sister, Ziling,

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.650
disappeared precisely after
visiting Changsheng Temple.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.230
Then why didn't she report it
to the authorities?

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.390
How do you know she didn't?

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.450
Officer Huang, you seem
to dislike government officials a lot.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:34.350
Yes.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.280
I dislike them.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.590
But you guys are exceptions.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:41.810
Mao.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.310
Did you find any clues?

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:45.940
I found

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.000
Mrs. Chen would go to Changsheng Temple
to pray

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
on the first and 15th of every month.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.320
Do you think

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.520
Mrs. Chen's death

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.890
could be related to Changsheng Temple too?

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.280
It's possible.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.840
It seems
Changsheng Temple is very suspicious.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:00.840
Then...

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.880
we should go to Changsheng Temple
to investigate.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.940
Darling, I'm begging you.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.390
This place is really effective.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.980
Let's pray and worship here, okay?

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.790
We'll have a child soon.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:17.910
Darling,

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.880
was everything you said about loving me
a lie?

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.520
Don't you want to have a child with me?

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.120
-Let's just pray...
-Let go!

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.000
My Lord, calm down.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:26.710
Calm down.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.420
Calm down, calm down.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.020
I just asked him to act.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.630
Why did he use so much strength?

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.950
Lord Shen asked you to act,

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.320
but you refused.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:39.799
If you still can't bear a child,

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:41.710
I will divorce you and marry someone else!

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:42.880
Suit yourself!

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:46.250
Darling!

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.390
You can't do this to me!

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.490
Darling!

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:51.990
My Lord, you are truly brilliant.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.790
Impressive.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.100
It's okay. It's okay.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.050
Why is my life so miserable?

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.570
Tell you what,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:02.940
Yu's acting

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.700
is really convincing.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:06.280
Yes.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.310
Immortal,

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.920
please save me!

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.630
Immortal, I'm Pu Yu.
Please answer my prayer.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.230
Please bless me with a child.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.970
If my wish comes true,

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.550
I will serve you for the rest of my life.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:37.590
I

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.570
have heard the sincere prayer of you,
Pu Yu.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.490
Just drink this bottle of Holy Water,

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.910
and your wish will come true.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.180
Thank you for answering my prayer.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.110
Thank you for answering my prayer.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:11.960
Crap.
