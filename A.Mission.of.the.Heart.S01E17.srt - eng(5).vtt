[A Mission of the Heart]

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.890
[Episode 17]

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.120
Officer Huang must have been hit

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.020
with the Weakness Powder.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.060
It doesn't just cause fatigue.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.300
It also has aphrodisiac
and hallucinogenic effects.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.280
That filthy Taoist!

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.010
If he dares to lay a finger on Yu,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.360
I'll skin him alive!

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.150
It has only been a moment.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.460
She must still be in the temple.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.530
Zhao, Mao,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.750
you two search the outside.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.750
Shen Pan and I will check the inside.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.500
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.150
Shen Pan.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.150
How's it going?

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.480
My Lord.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.640
We've searched everywhere,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.840
but we found nothing.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.520
Impossible.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.040
That's impossible!

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.400
This Changsheng Temple isn't very large.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.680
To hide someone in such a short time,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.360
there must be a secret passage
or chamber.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.360
Keep searching.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.849
Even if we have to turn the whole temple
upside down,

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.260
we must find her!

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.940
If we can't find her here,

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:09.510
expand the search into the mountains.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.270
Keep looking!

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.680
Yes.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.230
Yes.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.840
Let's go.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.000
We know nothing about her background.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.860
She's not even on our list.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.460
You shouldn't have kidnapped her.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.380
I have already checked it.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.200
There's absolutely no problem.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.910
But...

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.050
No buts.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.850
If that lord hadn't

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.830
accidentally killed Mrs. Chen,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.190
I wouldn't

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.229
have resorted to such a move.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.930
Without the list provided by Mrs. Chen,

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.930
I have to find my own way.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.160
Our plan cannot stop.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.190
If it stops,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.190
all our previous efforts
will be for nothing.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.440
Can you afford

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.229
that responsibility?

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.930
Then be careful.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.410
My little beauty,

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.250
let me

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.930
give you some real pleasure.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.570
I promise I'll make

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.700
you pregnant.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.360
This isn't Lord Lu.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.330
Ms. Huang?

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.720
Miss Ziyan?

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.840
Why are you here?

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.860
I got caught by them while trying

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.820
to uncover the truth for my sister.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.420
Now is not the time to talk about this.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.270
You...

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.150
You go get that girl

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.070
and bring her back.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.780
Since you've already exposed yourself,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.640
there's no need for you to live anymore!

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.230
Let's go!

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.070
The Taoist is dead. Let's escape now!

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.820
He's dead?

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.650
Thank goodness!

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.050
Follow me. I know where the exit is.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.230
Let's go!

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.190
Be careful!

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.930
The old bastard died just like this?

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.810
He really didn't suffer enough.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.460
We need to find Yu as quickly as possible.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.800
Let's go.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.330
Let's go.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:08.570
Hurry!

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.320
Hurry!

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.600
Ziyan, take this.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.660
I'm leaving their safety
in your hands now.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.270
What about you?

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:27.690
Don't worry. I'm from the Imperial Guard.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.830
I'll take care of myself.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.980
Take care of them.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.230
Be careful!

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.110
Stop running!

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.380
Hurry!

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.030
Stop!

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.090
Lord Shen?

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.500
Lord Shen?

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.730
It's Lord Shen!

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.690
Miss Ziyan.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:12.890
Miss Ziyan.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.480
Why isn't Huang Yu with you?

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.110
To protect us, Ms. Huang

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.130
lured those people away by herself.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.780
My Lord.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.610
My Lord.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.130
Zhao, take them back.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.730
Yes.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.120
Mao,

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.900
escort them to a safe place.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:27.570
I'll go find Yu.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.530
Yes, My Lord.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:33.530
Huang Yu!

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.550
Huang Yu!

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.880
How's it going?

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.070
I still haven't found them.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:55.360
My Lord.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.240
What about you?

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.380
No sign of Lord Lu and Officer Huang.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.540
Send more men.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.380
Find them at all costs.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.660
Yes.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.030
It hurts.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.190
-Yu.
-It hurts.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.700
Bear with it a little longer.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.760
I'll pull the arrow out for you first.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.340
I'll apply medicine for you.

Yu.

Zhao,

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:05.250
hurry and examine Yu!

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:05.920
Okay.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.250
How is Yu doing?

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.110
She's not well.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.560
What do you mean by that?

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.510
After suffering severe injuries,

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.790
Yu was soaked in water.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.880
And now she has a persistent high fever.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.940
If this continues,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.560
I'm afraid she might...

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.620
That won't happen!

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:25.340
Yu will be fine.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.030
Zhao.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.870
Last time,

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:34.429
I asked you to investigate

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:36.510
if there's any connection
between Jiang Ning and Yu.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:37.970
You said there wasn't any.

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:39.380
Focus on investigating

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.909
what Jiang Ning did

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:42.230
before Yu turned 5 years old.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.909
Yes.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:15.140
Yu.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:17.880
Yu.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.850
Yu, it's me.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.070
It's me, Yu.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.240
My Lord.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.770
Yu.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.800
I'm here.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.150
It's all over now.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:34.810
You'll be alright, Yu.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:36.240
I'm here.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:40.370
Everything's fine now.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:41.120
Don't be afraid.
