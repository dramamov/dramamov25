[A Mission of the Heart]

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:10.950
[Episode 18]

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.440
Why

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.790
does Yu like Lu Zhan?

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.050
Lu Zhan is...

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.550
Lu Zhan is nothing.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.410
Lu Zhan is just

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.430
a complete dolt when it comes to romance.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.150
He's also a cold fish.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.930
Why does Yu like Lu Zhan?

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.420
In what way am I worse than Lu Zhan?

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.130
Is this really my lord

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.000
who once conquered every heart?

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:05.910
Lu Zhan!

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.900
Damn you!

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.660
Dare to fight me one on one?

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.340
Zhao.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.980
How's the investigation going?

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:24.940
5 years ago,

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.340
Ling Yuanhang,
the former Minister of Justice,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.270
plotted a rebellion.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.850
Mu Qingfeng, the Vice Minister,
was implicated.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.830
Both families were dismissed from office,
their properties confiscated.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.550
Jiang Ning was the one
in charge of the case back then.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.000
Due to his merits in handling the case,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.479
he was exceptionally promoted.

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.080
He gained the appreciation of Zhao Yutang,
the Minister of Personnel,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.140
rapidly rising
to Vice Minister of Personnel.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.930
Yu has no memory from before the age of 5

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.520
and has frequent nightmares.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.360
She must have suffered some trauma
in her childhood.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.780
When the Ling family's property
was confiscated,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.240
were there any survivors?

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:51.880
Zhao.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.289
Zhao!

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.840
What are you thinking about?

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.759
Nothing.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.440
Were there any survivors
from the Mu family?

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.060
No.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.590
Focus on investigating these two families.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.070
Yes.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.360
Youlan?

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.950
The ghost bride case!

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.000
Youlan was actually the daughter
of the Minister of Justice,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.829
Ling Zhang?

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.829
Yu.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.540
You're still not fully recovered.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.790
Why not go back to your room and rest?

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.510
No need.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.720
It's so stuffy inside.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.780
Coming out lets me get some fresh air.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.640
All right. Let's do as you say.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.820
I'll get you some tonics

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.950
to help you recover.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.390
Thank you, Lord Shen.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.950
My Lord.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.260
You may need to go to Changsheng Temple.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.800
These women

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.960
all had their abdomens cut open.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.000
When I was drugged unconscious,

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.030
I heard that Taoist mention

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.700
that some plan must not stop.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.400
I thought they were just killing
for money.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.480
I never expected

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.620
it was for the fetuses.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.079
Some plan?

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.150
What were they using these fetuses for?

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.660
A Taoist temple...

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.020
The fetuses...

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.380
I think

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.000
Taoist Xuyun
must have been using the fetuses' blood

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.410
to refine elixirs.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.590
I've also heard

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.290
that recently,

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.490
there was a fake Taoist
in the imperial court,

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.240
who had gained the Emperor's trust.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.780
It's said that the elixirs he refines

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.430
can slow aging

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.070
and make one rejuvenate.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.390
Could this be what they're talking about?

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.210
Most likely.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.120
A batch of elixirs was inspected
at Changsheng Temple.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.080
The imperial physician said
they were just piles of tonics,

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.740
with no special ingredients.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.280
But among them,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.130
there was a faint smell of blood.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.360
This is too cruel!

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.450
They're even using fetuses!

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.590
We can't let them get away with this!

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.180
My Lord.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.899
What's so urgent?

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.180
Lu Zhan and the others

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.070
have discovered that batch of elixirs.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.880
Black Hawk!

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.770
What were you thinking?

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.510
Why didn't you clean things up completely?

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.770
My apologies. I have failed in my duties.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.800
There's no point in talking about it now.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.830
I'm only worried that if this goes on,

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.350
Lu Zhan and the others will find

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.610
where we're hiding the official silver.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.320
We only have two Moon Stones.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.640
If we can't gather all the Moon Stones,

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.700
we won't get the money at all, My Lord.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.550
Chen Zhao!

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.790
What's

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.120
the meaning of this?

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.400
Nothing.

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:51.770
My Lord,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.120
Mr. Wang and I risked our lives
to rob the official silver.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.180
We just want extra insurance.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.030
If something really happens to us,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.150
you two lords will also be implicated.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.600
How dare you threaten us?

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.060
-What do you think you're doing?
-Lord Jiang.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.590
There's no need to be angry.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.210
Once things cool off,

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.590
we'll just take our fair share.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.940
We'll never be greedy for more.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.670
Black Hawk.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.110
Wipe them out.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.350
We need to investigate

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.890
which court officials Xuyun
had dealings with

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.750
and where those elixirs ended up.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.159
It just came back to me.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.470
Mrs. Chen must have been one of them.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.650
Mrs. Chen was involved in this too?

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.770
Mrs. Chen

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.570
was probably responsible
for choosing targets

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.330
and luring them into the temple,

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.900
where the Taoist
would then rape them

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.159
and get them pregnant.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.680
Since Mrs. Chen was one of them,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.960
why did they kill her?

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.190
Could it be

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.890
she wanted that lord to marry her?

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.590
It's not impossible.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:07.510
Shen Pan,

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.470
you've met Mrs. Chen before.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.860
What kind of woman do you think she was?

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.060
I think she was no ordinary woman.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.860
Mrs. Chen was playing with fire.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.210
She must have prepared an escape route
for herself.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:20.590
My Lord,

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.640
are you suspecting
that Mrs. Chen had evidence

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.330
that could convict them?

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.560
That's possible.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.760
I've been to Mrs. Chen's room before.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.040
She had a habit of keeping records.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.900
I wonder where she hid the evidence

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.610
she recorded.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:39.480
My Lord.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.110
These are private works
between my husband and me.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.510
I fear they might offend your eyes,
My Lord.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:46.830
It's in the coffin.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:00.940
We're ambushed!

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:05.480
It's you?

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:06.310
Kill them!

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.420
Yu, stay out of this fight.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:32.690
I'll handle this.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.820
My Lord!

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.480
I have 10,000 ways

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.070
to make your death slow.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.550
I advise you to confess honestly.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Then you might suffer less torture.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.760
I know nothing.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.950
I was just following orders.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.100
Whose orders?

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.050
Jiang Ning, the Vice Minister of Revenue.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.160
Was he the one who killed Mrs. Chen too?

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.930
She used the child in her belly

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.320
to force my master to marry her.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.059
In a fit of rage, my master

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.730
killed her by accident.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.000
If Chen Zhao dies,

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.059
will you marry me?

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:42.679
It's not the right time yet.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:47.430
I think you just want
to marry someone else!

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.110
Don't worry.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.730
Once this is done,

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.350
I will treat you well.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.530
I've kept track of everything

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.520
you made me do.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:03.900
Are you threatening me?

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.770
Tell me where the book is!

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.980
Y-You actually...

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:10.950
This is...

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.880
Cut the crap!

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.590
That's it?

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.770
Yes.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.260
Did you kill Wang Mang?

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.610
My master was afraid
Wang Mang couldn't withstand the torture,

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.330
so he had me poison Wang Mang beforehand.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.040
Besides Wang Mang, Jiang Ning,
and Chen Zhao,

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.570
who else was involved
in the relief fund case?

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:34.670
I don't know.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.760
Where are the relief funds now?

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.230
I don't know.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.980
And where are those infants?

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.580
That was all Taoist Xuyun's doing.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.330
I don't know where they are.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:48.240
You don't know, huh?

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:50.680
You think I won't kill you?

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.440
You think I won't kill you?

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:58.990
Yu.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:00.680
What's wrong?

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.440
Yu.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.440
Don't touch me!

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.140
Yu.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.040
Don't touch me!

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.280
-Don't kill me!
-Yu, it's me!

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.420
I'm not Jiang Ning!

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.460
My Lord.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.700
It's me.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.670
You know everything now?

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.960
Was it Jiang Ning

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.770
who hurt you?

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.480
Actually,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.790
my real name is Mu Ningzhao.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.460
My father was Mu Qingfeng,
the former Vice Minister of Justice.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.750
When I was 5 years old,

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.870
it was Jiang Ning

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.400
who framed my father for treason.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.960
Mu Qingfeng, you embezzled military funds.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.150
The evidence is solid.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.130
Damn you, Jiang Ning!

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.380
I was so blind

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.200
to have treated you as my friend!

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.350
Since then,

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.340
I've been all alone.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.490
Yu.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.020
I swear I'll avenge you

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.150
and clear your Mu family's name.
