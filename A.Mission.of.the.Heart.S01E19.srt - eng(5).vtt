[Northern Inspection Division]

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.050
My Lord.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.000
My Lord.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.600
How did it go?

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.490
We arrived late.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.820
Jiang Ning had run away.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.810
Issue an arrest warrant.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.240
Search the entire city for him.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.970
Anyone who shelters or harbors him

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:26.830
will be charged as well.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:27.310
Yes.

[Wanted]

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.630
My Lord,

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.450
Miss Ziyan is asking to meet you.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.350
Miss Ziyan?

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.530
Let her in now.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.350
Miss Ziyan.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.380
Lord Shen.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.400
Ms. Su,

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.010
what brings you here?

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.250
I'd like to thank you
for redeeming me from the brothel

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.190
and renting

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.200
a garment shop

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.090
for us girls who had nowhere to go.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.400
What's this?

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.770
I'm not able to offer much

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.450
to repay your kindness.

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.600
My friends and I
made these clothes for you.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.660
I hope you won't find them too shabby.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.870
Of course I won't.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.120
Thank you, Ms. Su.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.510
Oh, right.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.200
I owe thanks to Ms. Huang too.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.259
If it hadn't been for her help,

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.590
those girls and I

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.490
would have been killed already.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.650
I barely have anything valuable,

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.780
so I made these clothes for her myself.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.450
How thoughtful of you, Ms. Su.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.700
I'll bring your gifts to her.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.860
Let bygones

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.030
be bygones.

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.430
Your priority is to go on with your life.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.479
Goodbye, Ms. Su.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.370
Commander Li.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.470
Is it possible

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.460
that Jiang Ning has fled the city?

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.080
We've been searching for days,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.080
yet not a trace of him could be found.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.830
Commander Li,

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.570
Jiang Ning's body
was discovered in the mountain.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.570
Inform Lord Lu of it.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.060
Yes.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.500
Let's go.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.640
Jiang Ning was killed by the poison
on a hidden weapon.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.440
The murderer ambushed
the Vice Minister of Personnel.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.240
This person is a major criminal.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.750
I think

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.550
the killer of Jiang Ning,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.600
who also made the Black Hawk say
Jiang Ning was the culprit,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.310
is the real mastermind.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.740
But now, with Jiang Ning being dead,

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.940
the lead has dried up.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.700
How are we supposed
to find the real mastermind?

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.360
[Northern Inspection Division]

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.160
These are the trivial matters
that the court officials do every day.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.050
Since the murderer and Jiang Ning
were acquainted,

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.710
they must've interacted.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.070
More than once, I'd say.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.620
But Jiang Ning
had contact with so many people.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.450
How do we identify the murderer?

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.579
Time.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.940
Time?

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.920
For private dealings,

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.320
they wouldn't meet up at their own places.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.570
I got it.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.650
That is to say,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.829
we only need to find out

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.210
who went out and came home

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.940
at a similar time to Jiang Ning.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.400
How smart of you, Yu.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.070
My Lord, Lord Shen requests an audience.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.480
Has Lord Shen found a lead

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.060
within such a short time?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.079
Lord Shen.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.210
Yu,

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.400
Miss Ziyan

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.520
asked me to bring you this.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.820
Miss Ziyan told me

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.250
that you helped her open a garment shop.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.220
It's very kind of you, Lord Shen.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.900
"It's very kind of you, Lord Shen."

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.800
If there's nothing else,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.040
you may leave now, Lord Shen.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.860
There is indeed something else.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.550
This hairpin is also for you.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:24.070
She said she noticed
that you had glanced at it a few times.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.740
Thinking that you might like it,

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.800
she wanted you to keep it as a gift too.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.940
Did you take a liking to it, Yu?

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.430
Not really.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.620
I just found it familiar,

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.159
as if I had seen it somewhere.

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.950
Lord Shen,

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.600
did she tell you
where this hairpin came from?

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.100
I did ask her about it.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.260
I remember,

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.560
when she handed this hairpin to me...

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.090
Besides, this plum blossom hairpin...

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.020
Please give it to Ms. Huang as well.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.470
This hairpin must be

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.170
important to you, isn't it?

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.050
I don't think Yu would accept
someone else's beloved item.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.820
I used to work with a friend

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.360
named Youlan in Yanyu Brothel.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.750
She gave it to me.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.350
This was her favorite hairpin
when she was alive.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.760
What a shame

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.820
that she is gone forever.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.230
Do you know how she died?

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.230
A client abused her.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.630
She was tortured to death.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.960
Then she was forced into a ghost marriage.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.750
Do you know who that client was?

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.210
No.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.530
All I can remember

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.330
is that he lost a finger.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.430
He lost a finger?

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.990
Youlan?

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.870
He's an animal!

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.610
You guys are not in sync at all, are you?

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.990
By the way,

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.530
how's the investigation

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.220
on Jiang Ning's murder going?

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:38.360
At the moment,

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.200
we only have a tiny clue.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.980
According to these records,

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.540
only Zhao Yutang got home at the same time

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:45.870
as Jiang Ning.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.020
Our findings

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.290
are not enough
to take the Minister of Personnel down.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.260
We need to find more evidence.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.930
Zhao.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.480
Zhao?

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.090
My Lord.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.040
Why have you been so absent-minded lately?

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.230
Go.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.540
Have someone watch the Zhao Mansion.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.410
Notify me anytime

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.810
when something happens.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.730
Yes.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.450
You old scumbag.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.180
How dare you betray me?

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.040
If you hadn't accidentally
killed Mrs. Chen,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.670
Lu Zhan wouldn't have
traced to Changsheng Temple,

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.440
and I wouldn't have had to resort to
this desperate measure.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.840
Cut the crap.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.870
Give me a pass to leave the city

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:40.640
and 10,000 taels in bank notes,

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.960
or I'll kill you!

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.390
If anything happens to me,

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:47.930
you'll be doomed too.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.950
Go to Jiangnan Bank.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.880
I own that place.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.830
You'll get your money there.

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:01.870
But how can I trust you?

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.870
You have no choice but to trust me now.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.190
That... was a sneak attack.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.220
You old scoundrel!

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:18.960
You thought

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:20.870
you could threaten me?

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.750
This money

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.990
can only be mine.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.020
If you want the Moon Stone back,

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.800
meet me at Changsheng Temple
at nine tonight.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.480
Too bad that the note was burned.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:53.500
Otherwise,

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.630
we would know Zhao Yutang's whereabouts.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.290
And this plum blossom dart...

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.100
A regular plum blossom dart

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.500
usually has five petals.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:02.830
But look at this one.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.510
It has six petals.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.200
There must be

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.170
a special meaning behind this.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.490
The ghost-masked man
truly acts mysteriously.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.240
He helped Xue Jingshu and Zhou Yue

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.780
get their vengeance.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.100
He also provided Mrs. Chen with guidance.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.220
As we traced to Zhao Yutang,

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.530
he instantly took this man away.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.480
Not many people

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.150
know about the Moon Stone.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.830
All those related to the relief fund case
already died.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.169
How did the ghost-masked man
get the information?

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:32.929
No.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:34.900
Some of those people are still alive.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:35.710
Who?

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.179
Those responsible for
investigating the case.

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:39.980
Lu Zhan,

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:41.309
what are you implying?

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:42.830
Are you suspecting me?

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.260
If I suspected you,

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.920
I would've caught you
and interrogated you under torture.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:58.520
Yu.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:00.700
What's on your mind?

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.180
Nothing.
