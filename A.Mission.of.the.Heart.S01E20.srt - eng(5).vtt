[Episode 20]

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.110
Thirteen years ago,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.030
Ling Yuanhang's entire family was executed

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.510
due to rebelling

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.560
and embezzling military funds.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.600
His eldest daughter, Ling Zhang,
was sold to Yanyu Brothel.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.460
The whereabouts of his son, Ling Xiao,
was unknown.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.000
At 10, Ling Xiao
had exceptional lightness skills

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.460
and excelled in medicine.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.380
The ghost-masked man
also knows about the Moon Stone.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.200
Back when the Ling family was purged,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.660
were there any survivors?

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.890
Zhao.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.430
What are you thinking about?

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.100
Nothing.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.100
Did the Mu family have any survivors?

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.980
No.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.930
My Lord.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.330
Where is Commander Li?

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.130
Commander Li went to take a bath.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.580
Where would Zhao Yutang go
to keep the appointment?

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.950
Could it be Changsheng Temple?

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.950
Shen Pan!

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.930
Shen Pan!

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.640
Has Yu come to you?

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.700
No.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.860
Crap!

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.280
Yu is missing!

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.420
Yu is missing?

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.810
Wasn't she with you?

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.190
I think she was taken by Li Zhaoxia.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.380
Li Zhaoxia?

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.950
Why would he take Yu?

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.150
I found out that Li Zhaoxia

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.800
might be the ghost-masked man.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.060
Yu was probably taken

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.000
because of that.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.270
You're saying
Li Zhaoxia is the ghost-masked man?

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.729
We must rescue Yu quickly.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:11.640
My Lord,

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.910
we've tracked down
the ghost-masked man's whereabouts.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.690
Go!

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.420
Call the Imperial Guards!

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.540
Commander Li,

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.810
I have no grudge against you.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.640
Why are you doing this to me?

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.390
Why?

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.220
Because you deserve to die!

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.670
Youlan, whom you tortured to death,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.150
was my sister, Ling Zhang.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.470
I am Ling Xiao, the son of Ling Yuanhang,

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.910
Vice Minister
of the Judicial Review Court.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.360
It was Chen Zhao and Jiang Ning

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.670
who framed the Ling family!

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.550
It has nothing to do with me!

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.210
You're still making excuses!

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.860
Do you really think

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.080
I came here alone?

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.310
To tell you the truth,

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.000
if anything happens to me today,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.370
you won't survive either.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.850
So what?

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.620
Get up!

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.600
What you owe the Ling family—

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.880
I'll make you pay for it

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.450
cut by cut.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.400
Ling Xiao!

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:37.670
Stop.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.770
You know everything?

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.450
Yes.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.630
You're going to stop me too?

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.310
Have you forgotten

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.550
how our families were wiped out?

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.750
I haven't forgotten!

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.210
But Zhao Yutang shouldn't die here.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.190
We should expose his crimes

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.830
and clear our names openly and justly!

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.190
Openly and justly?

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.220
Ningzhao.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.550
You're still too naive.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.360
The court today is corrupt.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.910
There's no justice.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.330
There's no justice!

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.590
Zhao!

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.360
My Lord!

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.510
Shut up.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.210
Fine.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.800
I won't go over there.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.000
I won't go over there.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.880
Zhao,

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.940
I have obtained

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.909
all the evidence needed
to bring Zhao Yutang to justice!

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:39.820
Release them first!

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:40.530
Enough!

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.030
Zhao,

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.820
Mrs. Chen's booklet

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.860
records all the evidence
of Zhao Yutang's crimes!

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.180
The donations to Changsheng Temple

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.710
were all embezzled by him!

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.909
With this,

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.090
it's enough to clear the names
of the Ling family and the Mu family!

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.970
Clear our names?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.480
He caused the extermination
of the Ling family.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.280
He caused my sister
to die tragically in a brothel.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.680
If I don't tear him into pieces,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.660
it won't be enough
to ease the hatred in my heart!

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.240
Ling Xiao.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.480
Listen to me.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.920
I believe your father and mother

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.520
wouldn't want you to do this.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.830
All these years,

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.030
your sister never looked for you

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.290
just because she wanted you to live well!

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.260
Thirteen years ago,

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.230
Ling Xiao was already dead.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.620
Already dead!

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.550
Zhao!

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.000
Back when the Ling family was wiped out,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.770
my master secretly took me to a valley.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.440
He told me

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.000
not to seek revenge.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.590
But when I found out my sister

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.380
died an unnatural death

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.630
and was forced into a ghost marriage,

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.110
how could I not hate?

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.040
So...

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.070
that's why
you were willing to help Xue Jingshu?

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.610
Yes.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.110
I targeted everyone
involved in ghost marriages!

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.970
If I had known earlier

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.700
that Zhao Yutang was the one
who killed my sister,

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.850
how could I have let him live until now?

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.150
What about Chen Zhao?

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.200
Why did you use Zhou Yue

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.450
to kill Chen Zhao?

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.050
Chen Zhao was my sister's fiancé.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.020
But he colluded with Jiang Ning,

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.880
intentionally framing my father

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.220
and causing my sister

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.310
to end up in a brothel.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.480
If I hadn't wanted
to keep my identity secret,

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.860
I would have killed him
with my own hands long ago.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.780
Even so,

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.870
your enemy is Zhao Yutang!

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.240
Why did you capture Yu?

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.380
No one can stop me.

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:51.720
After I kill Zhao Yutang,

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.610
I will apologize to you all.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.320
That's just your wishful thinking.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.430
Perhaps you all don't know yet,

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.230
but my men will be here soon.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.920
No one can leave!

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.920
Your men have been wiped out by us.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.280
Impossible.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.490
Since that's the case,

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.180
let's all die here!

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:39.400
Crap!

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.940
Zhao Yutang, I'm going to kill you!

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.960
Zhao Yutang and the others
framed loyal officials,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.800
embezzled official silver,

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:52.640
accepted bribes,

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.280
sold official positions,

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.390
and corrupted the court's discipline.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.120
In the end, they were beheaded.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.950
The names of the Ling and Mu families

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.530
were cleared.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.960
I never intended to harm Yu.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.630
I know.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.480
Please help me...

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.480
apologize to Yu.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.260
She has never blamed you.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:34.110
Why did you save me?

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.790
Because you, Li Zhaoxia,

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:54.610
are my subordinate.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.820
Why didn't you tell me from the start?

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.030
If I had told you earlier,

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.990
perhaps the outcome
would have been different.
