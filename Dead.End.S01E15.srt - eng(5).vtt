The college entrance exam is next week.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:50.120
How is it?

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.640
Where are you going to go?

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:53.070
It depends on my scores.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.790
I'll go wherever I can get in.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:55.520
Are you under a lot of pressure?

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:56.680
It's okay.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:58.510
Your time is limited.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.060
I'll ask you in a straight way.

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:04.190
What happened to Tian Chang?

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:05.830
Which Tian Chang?

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.960
Tian Hao's daughter
from the steamed bun shop.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.510
Her parents said you knew each other.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:11.640
Now she's missing.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.970
And they said it's related to you.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:15.310
I don't know.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.920
Maybe the hutong killer killed her.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.440
How did you know

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.680
she was killed?

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:34.950
Dongdong,

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:37.720
tell me the truth.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.450
Do you really not know Tian Chang?

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.110
No, I don't.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.920
Then why did she have

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.050
your exercise book?

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.650
Even if you lost your backpack,

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.550
she shouldn't have

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:52.350
picked up your exercise book
to use, right?

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.680
Wasn't she a runaway?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.930
She had no exercises to do, I guess.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.730
Where did you lose your bag?

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.180
I lost it after school.

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:00.970
I don't remember where it was.

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:02.110
So Tian Chang's missing

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:03.070
really has nothing to do with you

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.790
at all?

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:07.070
Her parents

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:08.960
are at the station every day,
making a scene.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.590
Your dad might face disciplinary action
because of this.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.450
You really need to tell the truth.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:31.590
At this time,

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.400
if we can find Tian Chang,

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.880
everything will be fine.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.600
Tian Chang can take
the college entrance exam.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:40.000
Why are you all willing to

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.510
make decisions for others?

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:43.350
She left because
she doesn't want to come back.

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:44.880
That was her decision.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.440
But if you get involved,

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.700
this will implicate you and your father.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:51.270
Don't be silly, Dongdong.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.250
But I really don't know.

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:13.070
Fine.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.070
I always think

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:17.200
it has nothing to do with you.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.530
Her parents are just making wild guesses.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.400
Right?

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.160
I've finished my routine questions.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.090
You leave go now.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.310
Can I really go?

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:31.350
What else?

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.130
You don't know the clue, do you?

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:36.590
Then I'm leaving.
