00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.600
Help me with this suitcase.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:47.430
Didn't we agree to eat together?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.360
Where did they go?

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:57.910
Where did you get the gun?

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.680
It was issued by the station.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.750
It was given to the on-duty officer.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.880
-You were on duty that day?
-Yes, I was.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.170
Why did you fire?

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.120
I don't remember.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.550
Just do whatever

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.350
you want to me.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:30.960
Chief Zhu.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:34.530
I'll believe it

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.820
if you say Dongdong and Tian Chang

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:38.550
were in a relationship.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.100
But you say Dongdong might be the killer?

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.200
Do you even believe that yourself?

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.050
No, we don't believe it either.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.630
But right now,

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.550
that kid won't tell the truth.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:56.310
He even knows how to deal with us.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.320
The details he gave

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.920
were perfectly consistent.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.560
We know

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.480
he's lying,

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.770
but we have no choice but to investigate.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.270
What about Ran Xi?

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.270
Something this big happened,

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.349
but where is he?

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:11.920
He's...

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.270
at the station.

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:17.430
Don't blame him for this yet.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.500
He really did his best.

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:27.240
I was only gone for a few days...

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:28.329
How did everything

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:30.520
turn upside down

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.750
the moment I got back?

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.000
No, no.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.400
Don't worry yet.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.800
We're still investigating.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.400
How can I not worry? I...

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.680
Chief Zhu, can I see him?

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.750
Which one?

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:50.480
My son.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.120
Beiping, how about this?

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.040
Once the investigation is done,

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.880
I'll arrange it immediately, okay?

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.720
Ran,

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.200
let me know if you need anything.

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:24.190
Are you hungry?
I'll make you instant noodles.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.590
Dongdong.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.920
Dad's here.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.200
Ran.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:42.110
Ran!

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:46.510
Ran!

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.200
Ran!

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.960
Dongdong.

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:51.440
-Ran.
-I know.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.480
Open the door.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.490
You must have

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.150
your reasons for doing this.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.160
I get it.

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:03.510
You are...

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:05.880
you are a kid

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.690
with a strong sense of justice.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.640
I know this very well.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.000
I just want to apologize to you.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.070
I'm sorry.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:27.450
The things I promised you before,

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.680
I actually didn't fulfill them.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.110
I'm sorry.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.850
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:45.960
I just want you

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.590
to be okay.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.720
Just explain what happened.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:52.990
Whether you can

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.240
take the college entrance exam or not,

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.300
it doesn't matter.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.880
Your mom and I

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.080
just want you to be okay.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.160
That's our only wish.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.200
Son,

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.440
your life is just beginning.

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.150
Everything will get better.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.350
This will pass.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.270
You...

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.270
you have to be okay.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:40.830
Ran.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.830
Ran!

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:43.590
Open the door.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.070
Ran.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:50.030
Ran!

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.480
Open the door!

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.030
Stop looking.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.090
Four of bamboos.

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:39.070
Why didn't you say it.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:39.640
I have a bad hand.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.840
Three of Characters.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.240
Are you Tian Chang?

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:21.750
Are you Tian Chang?

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:24.110
Dongdong's been arrested.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.840
He's at the police station now.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.030
You...

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.960
are the only one who can help him.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:36.540
[Missing Person]

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.790
Have you found your kid?

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:10.310
Who are you?

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:15.680
My daughter is gone too.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.680
Who are you?

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:22.750
Her name is Liu Ke.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:29.890
Oh, it's you.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.680
Please have a seat.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.340
Have a seat.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.000
Come on, come.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:39.880
Let me get you a beer.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.400
I've heard what happened to you.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:00.310
Don't be sad.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.680
Do you know who did it?

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:10.810
You ask me? Well...

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.280
What's the point of knowing?

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.370
Even if we do, we can't arrest him.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:27.640
Forget it.

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:31.750
How's your case going?

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:36.590
Almost there.

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:40.870
They can't catch the killer,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.400
so I have to do it on my own.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:45.200
On your own?

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.010
How can you do it on your own?

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:53.350
Let me ask you.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.980
You know Ran Xi, right?

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:00.750
Does this

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:03.150
have anything to do with him?

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:06.950
So you figured it out too?

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.610
I'm telling you,

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.480
I've known for a long time.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.720
His son

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.550
was the one who took my daughter.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.160
Ran Dongdong.

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:37.920
Think carefully again.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.760
Who else could it be besides him?

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.480
A kid his age...

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:46.480
wouldn't do something like that.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.480
Why wouldn't he?

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:49.680
I've been watching him

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.010
for quite some time now.

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:53.750
He's been courting my daughter,

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:55.510
sending her gifts

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:56.750
and all that.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:59.000
Such a young kid,

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:02.000
and I can’t do a thing about him.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:02.400
I...

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.770
I can't fight against them.

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:05.550
So,

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:06.790
how could we ever catch him?

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.250
You know who his father is.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.030
What kind of grudge

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.060
or hatred could run that deep?

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.790
No, no.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.250
You didn't understand.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.400
It's not about the grudge or hatred.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.750
He likes my daughter.

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:21.440
You understand?

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:24.400
He looks all innocent and honest,

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.330
but he's just...

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.000
a rascal.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.330

After investigation,

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:07.110
you're suspected of sexual assault

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.790
and rape.

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:10.720

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.110
