This doesn't concern you.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.920
I'm talking to you. What's your name?

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.510
Our facilities here are decent, right?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.750

What's going on here?

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.520
There's gotta be some kind of mistake.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.280
Just ask around and let me go, alright?

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.710
How's Mei doing?

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.030
She died

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.710
many years ago.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.640
You didn't know?

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.080
It was all
that ungrateful daughter of mine

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.030
who drove her to it.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.430
To be honest,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
it's for the best.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.050
If she hadn't died,
she'd just be suffering.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.710
Are you married?

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.130
I have no time for that.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.560
How can you not make time?

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.430
It's important.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:34.910
You have to make time.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.190
Is it because work's too busy,

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.430
or are there just
too many bad guys to catch?

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.430
What do you think?

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.430
Why do you ask me?

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.360
I remember

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.960
there was a nice

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.150
young lass

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.480
in the hutong back then.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.800
She was a nurse, wasn't she?

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.190
I even saw you two together

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.150
on my evening strolls.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.500
So you two never got together?

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.190
Come on.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.870
Let's chat. Why so quiet?

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.680
Let's chat.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.880
Let's talk about you.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.360

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.310
Yes. Look,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.070
what is the meaning of this?

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.360
Gan'e,

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.310
all these years,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.360
I've been a law-abiding citizen

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.800
in the hutong,

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.400
and all neighbours knew it.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.430
All these years,

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.080
you never looked into me.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.430
Ran never did,

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.240
nor did you.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.690
So why am I suddenly being investigated?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.310
Give me a hint.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.870
Did I offend someone?

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.120
Indeed.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.750
Why are you here?

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.870
Think carefully.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.850
Would we arrest you without evidence?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.430
I don't know.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.930
What evidence?

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.360
Let me tell you,

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.270
technology is advanced now.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.290
We can identify you just from the
dead skin you scrub off in the shower.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.240
Dead skin?

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.680
DNA, huh?

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.900
You're keeping up with the times.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.920
I... I don't get it.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.330

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.150
about all this.

I haven't made any mistakes.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.480

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.830
you talk about remembering...

I live with my memories every single day.

Let me tell you,

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.360
at my age,

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.510
that's all you have.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.430
I could talk for three days

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.000
and not cover it all.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.510
I've even thought about writing...

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.600
When you've done so many things
you shouldn't have,

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.330
of course it preys on your mind.

What have I done that was wrong?

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.140
when I, Tian, walk through the hutong,

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.070
I hold my head high,

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.070
right?

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.190

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.360

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.270
has never cheated on weight.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.070
I never bullied a child,

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:39.360
an elderly man, or an elderly woman.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.510
I never bullied anyone.

What about that murder
in the hutong back then?

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.690
Isn't that weighing on your conscience?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.200
Murder in the hutong?

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.990
I don't even dare think about it.

I truly regret.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.310
How could I have told Zhou Weiping

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.750
that I suspected

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.750
Ran Dongdong?

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.190
Zhou Weiping was already

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.650
suspicious of Dongdong.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.530
It only strengthened his urge

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.000
to kill.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:47.360
And then he went

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.560
and killed Ran Dongdong.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.680
Good grief!

Weren't you involved in

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.120
the killing too?

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.120
No wonder

He's harassing me!

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:21.920
Don't shout like that.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:22.510
Harassment!

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:23.270
Who's the pervert?

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:24.110
-Stop shouting nonsense!
-Help!

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.970
Stop shouting.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.300
Stop shouting.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:30.820
Stop shouting.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.340
Stop shouting.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.880
At first,

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:37.800
I didn't intend to kill her.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:40.970
What about the murder weapon?

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:48.750
I just wanted to

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.240
use that bottle

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.440
to confuse you all.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Who knew you'd actually believe it?

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:59.480
You said you targeted Zhang Dan

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:01.330
because of Tian Chang.

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:05.070
What about Liu Ke?

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:08.570
She didn't even know Tian Chang, did she?

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.480
I...

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.200
I...

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.880
That Liu Ke...

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:23.310
I...

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.480
That night,

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.640
I was just wandering around.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.200
I...

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.500
Anyway, she was a pretty young girl,

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:33.310
wearing revealing clothes.

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:34.590
I thought

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.400
she looked improper.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.400
So I followed her,

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.680
and our paths just aligned.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.000
I started harassing her

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:45.880
with the laser pointer.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:48.050
How did you harass her?

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:52.310
I aimed at

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.410
the exposed parts of her body.

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:56.750
Actually, I...

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:00.270
I... I just wanted to teach her a lesson.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.000
But... When she suddenly turned around

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.720
and I saw her face clearly,

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:10.400
I lost control.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.160
And then?

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.930
Then I...

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.000
Since I know those hutongs well,

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.000
I took a shortcut

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:20.070
and cornered her.

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:22.790
When I grabbed her,

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.790
and touched her body,

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.440
I completely lost it.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.920
So you slit her throat

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.550
with a knife?

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:43.920
To be honest, I...

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.240
My mind was

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:48.350
a complete mess;

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:50.550
it was all chaotic...

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:52.590
I don't remember.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.400
What about the knife?

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:56.770
Where's the knife now?

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.500
I threw it in the sewer.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.430
What about the other one?

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:05.240
Later, there was another victim—
a female factory worker.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.840
What female factory worker?

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:08.350
A tall one.

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:10.240
You tried to slit her throat

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.650
but missed and cut her collarbone.

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.790
Yes.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:17.830
She...

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:20.960
I was just about to act

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.330
when I thought someone was nearby,

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.790
so I got scared and ran.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.770
And what about Liu Zining before that?

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:30.030
Who?

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.540
The one whose home you broke into,

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.550
assaulted,

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.130
and then killed.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.010
No, that's not true.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.240
Gan'e, that wasn't me.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.270
I... I wouldn't dare
break into someone's house

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.070
to do something like that,

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:45.330
no matter how bold I am!

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:47.070
That definitely wasn't me!

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.180
That really wasn't me.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.350
I swear it wasn't me.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.880
What about Xiaolong,

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:04.070
Crazy Wu?

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:13.750
I heard someone say

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:15.350
he saw me.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.440
Sooner or later,

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:17.640
he'll remember everything.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:18.310
I wanted to see

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:19.440
who would take the blame for this.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.570
Don't get worked up.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.400
Hao,

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.170
I'm heading out.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.800
See you later.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:29.640
I thought,

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.350
since he's useless,

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.830
he might as well take the blame for me.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:23.730
[Tian Hao]

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.960
[Signature: Tian Hao]

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.880
Zhao Gan'e,

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:47.400
do you ever regret

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:50.690
being assigned to this precinct?

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:53.950
You're getting stuck with
a case like mine,

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.880
tethered to it for half your life?

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.679
I'm sorry about that.

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:40.230
Are you impotent or something?

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:48.880
You...

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:53.670
You don't understand this.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:37.630
The keys are on the table.

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.030
The keys are on the table.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.210
Put on my clothes

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:23.610
and take my ID card.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:24.710
This way they

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:25.670
won't find you.

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:29.080
There's no time.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:29.920
Hurry!

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:58.600
Are you ready?

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:14.960
Dongdong,

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.190
this might be the last time

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:18.360
we see each other.

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.360
You're the only person in the world

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.160
who's ever been truly good to me.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.810
We'll see each other again.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.220
We will definitely see each other again.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.480
We definitely will.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:40.550
We absolutely must see each other again.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.330
Did he confess everything?

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:04.980
Congratulations.

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.420
By the way, one more thing.

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:14.710
Do you remember Crazy Wu—

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:16.800
Xiaolong?

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Tian Hao admitted

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:22.670
he was the one who pushed him.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.020
How do you feel about that now?

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.960
Is that a required question?

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.150
Fine, let me feel.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:48.710
I don't feel

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.590
tired.

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.440
Maybe I'm really sick.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:03.800
Mentally ill.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.200
Mentally ill.

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.960
Mental illness is just a concept

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.490
created by psychiatrists.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.340
How did I just notice this?

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.840
The child looks like you,

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:40.040
and your husband

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:42.310
even bears a resemblance to you.

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:43.960
I just wanted to see

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.110
when you would finally pick up

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:46.150
this photo.

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:50.590
I actually saw it

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:51.850
on the first day I came.

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.800
How did we break up

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:57.880
back then?

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.110
Were we even together?

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:05.590
I don't even remember.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.520
[1994]

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:35.070
I'm sorry.

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:36.840
I failed to protect you

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.110
from Wang Kun.

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.080
I will definitely catch him.

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.840
It's partly my fault too.

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:46.240
I was too impulsive then.

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:49.920
But I'm fine now, aren't I?

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:52.920
Don't worry. It's okay.

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:09.280
You still remember this place?

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:10.670
Isn't this

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:12.150
where you first followed me?

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:13.190
Do you still

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:14.280
carry those kids' cookies around?

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.070
Why would I?

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:17.480
I'm not a nurse anymore.

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:21.350
Then what do you want to do in the future?

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:31.760
Say

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:34.360
you've got two roads ahead—

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:36.550
one where

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.520
you can see exactly where you'll end up,

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.510
the kind of life you'll have,

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:43.240
even the person you'll become.

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:45.480
The other's

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:47.910
full of uncertainty,

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:49.630
but every day

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:51.290
feels full of hope.

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:55.840
Which one would you take?

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:59.390
I'd go with the second one, no question.

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.440
Being a cop's

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.100
all about the unknown anyway.

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:05.360
You planning to

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:05.800
wear the badge forever?

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:06.530
Absolutely.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:11.220
What about you?

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.150
Me?

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:18.710
I would also choose the second path.

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:20.280
Then we're the same.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:22.800
Yes.

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:26.490
We'll get the same future.

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.880
You know,

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:32.430
abroad,

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.410
the therapist actually...

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.120
You've got something to do, huh?

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:47.400
Go ahead with your work.
