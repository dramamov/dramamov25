00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:18.440
Young Master Xie

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.120
Your writing is truly impressive.

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:22.800
Of course.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.640
I received an excellent education.

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:27.120
Is your homeland like Jin City?

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.039
Quite the opposite.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:29.679
Princess.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.559
Look.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.359
Quite the opposite.

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:34.759
How did those two end up together?

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.719
Let's go see.

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:40.920
Our land values men above women.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.359
Men live carefree lives.

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:45.079
There are places with equality.

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.520
Of course.

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.240
If you never travel,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.039
how will you know the world?

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.960
According to Young Master Xie,

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:53.159
the Masculine Virtue Class is flawed.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.759
Exactly, Mo Gongzi.

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:56.679
Here, everything is upside down.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.439
Men have no dignity at all.

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:59.560
You should know,

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.320
men elsewhere in the world

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.280
live completely different lives.

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:04.560
Take our Yue Kingdom,

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.840
we practice gender equality.

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:08.879
Both men and women can trade or govern.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.760
Young Master Xie.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.200
Since we're here, we should accept it.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.959
Since the princess chose us,

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:14.920
our lives should belong to her.

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.280
Mo Gongzi.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:19.640
Our lives belong to ourselves.

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:21.719
Why starve yourself for favor?

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:24.560
You look pale and frail from hunger.

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:27.040
Instead of being used for amusement,

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.120
why not walk the world?

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.560
See the vast lands.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.959
Be a true man, stand tall.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.879
Why must men live without dignity?

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:38.719
That makes sense.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.040
But it's hard to realize that here.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.519
Young Master Xie, our paths differ.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.439
I don't agree with you,

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:50.760
but I respect your view.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.239
I have other matters.

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:53.640
I'll take my leave now.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.359
They're used to a pampered life,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.640
like sheltered flowers.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.319
How could they endure hardship?

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.560
Equality between men and women?

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.080
How could that be possible?

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.240
Little Yuanyuan.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.360
Soon enough,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.680
you'll be just like them.

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.439
I know you all enjoy tea.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:22.759
So today I've arranged

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:24.520
a tea ceremony class for you.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.759
Thank you, Princess.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.479
Little Yuanyuan, I—

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:32.120
I've heard you're skilled in tea.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.360
This class is for you.

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:37.360
Don't disappoint me.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.360
Gentlemen,

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:40.800
let's begin.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.800
Liu'an tea.

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:53.080
Jinmen Tuanhuang.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.560
Guzhu Zisun.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:02.159
Pu'er.

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.719
Mengding Shihua.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.599
Young Master Xie, your tea skills need work.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.680
Isn't Little Yuanyuan best at tea?

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.919
Did I get it wrong?

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.479
Princess.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.479
New fabrics arrived outside the palace.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.479
Alright.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.919
Carry on.

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:31.280
Little Yuanyuan.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.719
Don't let me down.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.680
Farewell, Princess.

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:48.520
Young Master Xie.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.039
I'll give you one more chance.

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.599
Try this.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:53.680
What tea is this?

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:56.400
I can't tell.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.479
You—

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:00.919
The princess praised you,

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.599
said your tea skills are superb,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.919
even set up a tea test for you.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.280
But I don't see it.

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.520
Let me show you something.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.680
Taste this.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.680
What are you doing?

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.079
You're wasting the tea.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.240
Can you smell this?

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.040
Here we have

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:50.600
Bijian Mingyue,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.279
Huangshan Maofeng,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.920
and Wuyi rock tea.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.920
That's right.

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:56.079
Exactly.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.639
And also

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.199
Yuye Changchun,

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.120
Huizhou Songluo,

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:09.319
And one more,

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.600
Shenquan Xiaotuan.

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:14.879
Impressive.

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.560
Young Master Xie is a tea sage reborn.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.720
Madam.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.879
It's not that I don't know tea.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.839
I just disdain using tea tasting as a test.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.560
What are you doing?

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.040
You dare mock me?

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.879
A true man repays his grudges.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.959
I'll remember this debt.

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:57.240
Alright.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.240
I made this medicine myself.

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:05.360
It must be freshly prepared.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.920
Come every other day.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.120
You'll recover soon.

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:13.480
Thank you, Princess Er.

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:14.720
It's nothing.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.360
Princess Er has read so many books.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.519
You must be very learned.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.680
I am humbled in comparison.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.680
Not at all.

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:30.920
Just for amusement.

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:34.879
But I recently acquired a rare book.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.720
It records strange tales.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.839
I don't know if they're true

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.439
or just imagined.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.839
I'd love to hear more.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.759
It says there's a small land by the Eastern Sea.

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:52.920
Its people are uncivilized,

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.279
their ways are barbaric.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.759
They eat raw fish.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.160
So the people are stunted in stature,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.439
thin and frail.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.480
It's also called

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.680
The Stunted Isles.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.480
Also known as

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:07.920
Woguo.

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:11.759
I once traveled there.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.800
Where did you read about it, Princess?

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.920
Records of Origins.

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:30.759
My Records of Origins!

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.920
Wonderful!

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:37.120
Wonderful!

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:45.759
Princess

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:47.079
My Records of Origins
has been found again.

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:48.680
I got a bit emotional
after that.

00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:50.360
I was really
too abrupt.

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:51.800
Please, I hope
you don't mind.

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:53.759
It's nothing.

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:56.319
Since Young Master Xie
wrote this book,

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.399
it should be returned
to its owner.

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:01.160
Princess Er

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.360
I don't even know
how to thank you.
