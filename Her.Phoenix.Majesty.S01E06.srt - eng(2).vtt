00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.839
Follow heavenly principles,

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:20.120
suppress human desires.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:21.480
Maintain moderation,

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:22.719
adapt to the ways of the world.

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:24.199
The Book of Changes

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.920
is recited to illuminate reason.

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:29.719
Why is it so noisy today?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.799
I really can't stay here long.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.320
Young Master Xie

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:37.320
Why are you still here?

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:38.320
Lady Rong Heng

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.159
What are you doing?

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:41.679
The Imperial Kitchen prepared lots of fresh ingredients.

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:44.320
All the palace officials are busy buying supplies.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.240
Go take a look quickly.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:46.399
Sister Rong Heng

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:47.560
The Princess is calling you.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.399
I'll be right there.

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:49.759
Young Master Xie

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:50.520
Go on, hurry.

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:54.960
Forget it.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.799
Since the assessment is related to this,

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.640
I'll see what tricks I can come up with.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.760
Du Momo

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.480
These people have no sense at all.

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:08.760
I've been standing here for so long.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.519
Let me tell you some good news.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:12.159
Yesterday, the Imperial Kitchen

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.560
got a batch of fresh ingredients.

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.640
I thought you needed to prepare a culinary offering.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:18.519
So,

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:20.799
I had them delivered here first.

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:22.680
So you could pick first.

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:25.159
Thank you, Du Momo.

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:26.760
Take a look.

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.200
Aren't these just ordinary ginseng and seafood?

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.640
And these river clams.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.159
The Princess is tired of eating them.

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:35.200
That's right.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.959
Momo

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:37.319
Young Master Xie

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:38.480
What are we doing here?

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.120
The palace holds a night banquet every festival.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.280
We all have to present a culinary offering.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:43.439
A culinary offering?

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:44.400
Yes.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.599
Is this my assessment?

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:48.000
Yes, Young Master Xie.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.079
You can't be unaware, right?

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:52.400
You should look and pick too.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.640
We'll need them later.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.879
They were gathered by people over there.

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:57.239
They rushed here at top speed.

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:59.879
It takes two months to reach Jin City.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.760
The Imperial Kitchen only has these three.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.519
Since that's the case,

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:06.200
I'll take the ten taels of silver.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.280
I want it.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.919
Here it is.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.039
Careless, careless.

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.080
I actually forgot.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.840
It's Young Master Xie's first time at the banquet.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.639
Here.

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.800
This is the banquet procedure and notes.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.039
Hope it helps Young Master Xie pass the assessment.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.280
And earn the City Lord's reward.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.639
Sea cucumber.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.520
Cordyceps.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.199
Snow lotus from Tianshan.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.840
Such extravagance and waste.

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:29.479
I don't need it.

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:30.400
Five taels of gold.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.719
Ten taels of gold.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.919
Twenty taels.

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:36.240
Everyone,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.680
do you know

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:39.719
in this world,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.680
many people are still starving.

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.800
Such fine ingredients

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.319
might be food they've never tasted in their lives.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.120
Just for one dish,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.800
you are so picky,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.039
so extravagant and wasteful.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.400
Don't you feel ashamed?

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.039
Princess

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.800
Princess

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.439
Didn't I tell you to secretly help Xiao Yuanyuan?

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:00.240
Why did you come back?

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.960
Princess

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:02.439
I'm here for that very reason.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.400
That's my Xiao Yuanyuan.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.759
Well done.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.639
This assessment still needs to be

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.120
discussed with the Second Princess.

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.039
Xie Yuan is so perfunctory about this banquet.

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:20.639
He's really not as good as Mo Yu and Zhao Xiang.

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:22.719
Why are you still so happy?

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.719
What do you know?

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.360
All the men in this city

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.159
just flatter this Princess.

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:28.120
It's so boring.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.319
But Xiao Yuanyuan is different.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.159
Young Master Xie

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.960
A ghost!

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.199
It's me.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.080
Ruo Lin!

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:47.439
Ruo Lin.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.159
It's me.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.800
Ruo Lin.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.960
Ruo Lin has finally waited for you.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.280
You've been chopping wood here all this time?

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.120
Yes.

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.000
Young Master Xie.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.919
Ruo Lin has sacrificed so much for you.

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:06.759
A huge sacrifice.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:07.960
You lost that thing.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.680
Which one?

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.439
That one.

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:10.520
That one.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.479
Just...

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:13.159
A man's most precious thing.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.639
It's still here.

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:16.240
It's here.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:17.839
But it almost...

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:20.759
Forget it, never mind.

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:22.680
Anyway, Ruo Lin only needs to chop wood now.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.639
Nothing else matters.

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:24.759
As long as it's still here.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.079
As long as it's here, that's enough.

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:27.240
Do you want to check?

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:30.959
No need, no need.

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:31.720
Alright.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.439
Young Master Xie.

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:37.240
Want to eat?

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:38.079
What?

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.040
Steamed bun.

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:42.560
You eat this every day?

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.240
Yes.

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:44.439
It's delicious.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.560
You've really had it tough.

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:47.439
Go ahead and eat.

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:48.720
I eat pretty well in the palace.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.839
Then I'll eat.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.600
Young Master Xie.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.160
When I heard the Princess took in a handsome man,

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:59.480
and he was from Yue,

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:01.000
I thought about it.

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.680
It had to be you, Young Master Xie.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.399
So I tried my luck entering the palace.

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:09.720
Who knew I'd end up in the wood shed.

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:11.519
I wanted to find you.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.560
But the palace is so huge.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.240
I also...

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:23.680
Ruo Lin...

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.160
You've really suffered.

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:26.319
When we get out,

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:27.920
I'll find you a good wife.

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:31.439
No need.

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:33.519
Ruo Lin just needs to find you.

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:36.360
By the way,

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.040
Ruo Lin.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.519
You've been here so long,

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:40.319
Have you found a way out?

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:44.480
Ruo Lin was busy looking for you.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.759
Didn't think about escaping.

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:48.160
But I know,

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:50.000
The one who brought me in said,

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:51.120
Once you enter the palace,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
you're a servant for life.

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:56.399
That's it.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.399
That's it.

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:02.279
Looks like I need my own plan.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.160
Young Master Xie.

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:05.920
You have a way out?

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.639
Of course I do.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.959
Here,

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:11.240
the Hot Spring Palace sends people out daily to buy supplies.

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:12.800
We sneak in with them.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.600
Wear their clothes.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.319
Then we can get out.

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:15.279
Yes, Young Master Xie.

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:16.240
We leave tonight.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.879
That was the plan.

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:21.319
But they found out I knew.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.560
So they changed the rules.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.560
We can't get out now.

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:24.560
Young Master Xie.

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:26.319
So your plan was for nothing.

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:27.519
Just like you.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.839
Young Master Xie.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.720
Each day here means chopping one hundred logs.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.519
Two days, two hundred logs.

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:32.920
Three days, three hundred logs.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.360
I know you're suffering.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.639
Give me some time.

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:38.560
Once I find a way out,

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.639
I'll get us both out.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.720
Can you wait for me?

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:43.199
Alright.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.040
Okay.

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:46.480
Young Master Xie.

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:47.519
This palace is so big.

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:54.439
Too many people and eyes here.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.600
I have things to do.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.800
I have to go.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.759
Alright.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.319
Young Master Xie.

00:06:59.319 --> 00:06:59.800
I'll see you off.

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:05.240
Know yourself and your enemy,

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.439
and you will never be defeated.

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:10.560
If you know only yourself,

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:13.360
you win some, lose some.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.079
Princess.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.199
Young Master Xie is here.

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:18.240
Young Master Xie.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.800
Greetings, Second Princess.

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:21.160
No need for formalities.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.399
Princess.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.959
Are you really pawning all these jewels to help the people?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.680
How have I taught you?

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.519
These are just worldly possessions.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.439
If they can help the people,

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.319
then their existence is worthwhile.

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:39.480
Young Master Xie, you came today

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.240
to ask a favor.

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:43.360
The palace banquet is approaching.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.160
I wish to fail the assessment on purpose.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.000
However,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.199
the culinary offering here is always extravagant.

00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:01.079
Just do the opposite, and you'll fail.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.560
Xiao Cui.

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:06.519
Why is it crab pastry again?

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.199
Where's my favorite radish cake?

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.160
Forgive me, Princess.

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:10.800
The Imperial Kitchen said radish is cheap.

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:12.279
It's not worthy of your status.

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:13.839
So they stopped making it.

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:24.480
Who says ingredients have ranks and worth?

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:33.759
Young Master Xie.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.080
Ruo Lin.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.000
Everything you asked for is here.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.440
But what do you need these for?

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:41.639
You'll know soon enough.

00:08:41.639 --> 00:08:42.240
Go ahead.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:42.679
Be careful.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:43.399
Alright.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:08:59.879
Xiao Tao

00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:02.759
You said Young Master Xie locked himself
in his room, acting all mysterious.

00:09:02.759 --> 00:09:04.000
What is he up to in there?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.279
Can he pass the assessment?

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:06.240
I think he can.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.080
The banquet is coming soon.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.320
Let's see what surprises Young Master Xie
will bring.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:10.799
No.

00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:11.639
I can't wait any longer.

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:14.240
Go gather everyone.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.240
I want to taste the dishes myself.

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:18.000
If Xiao Yuanyuan doesn't prepare well,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.600
the Queen Mother will be furious.

00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:20.000
Yes.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:20.720
Princess.
