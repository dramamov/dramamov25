Rong Heng

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.039
This poetry collection is
no challenge for me.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.519
It’s not difficult at all.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.160
Go find another one
for me to try.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.039
Yes.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.479
If Xiao Yuan Yuan saw
my calligraphy,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.520
he’d be completely charmed.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.679
Princess, you’re so talented.

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:50.359
Xiao Yuan Yuan, you’re here!

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.079
The Mountain Climbing Ode
you chose

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.920
is truly the finest
of these works.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.719
Great minds think alike.

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.119
I think so too.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.439
These classics

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:05.680
were all written
by renowned masters.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:08.079
I hope you treasure them.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.040
Practice diligently.

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.120
That’s exactly my intention.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.480
Xiao Yuan Yuan.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.079
How about

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:14.799
you practice with me?

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:16.879
Please.

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:29.719
Princess,

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:34.120
you should calm down
and take it slow.

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:55.040
Mister Xie.

00:01:59.239 --> 00:01:59.959
Princess Er.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:01.159
No need to stand on ceremony.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.120
Mister Xie.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.680
Is something troubling you?

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.479
Just missing home
while gazing at the moon.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.840
Seeing you so homesick,

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.719
I truly feel for you.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.479
I hope you can return
to Yue soon.

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.360
Thank you, Princess Er.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.120
But the Princess

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.879
seems to tell me everything,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.159
but about the defenses,

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:30.560
she only shares a little.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.560
Looks like my journey home

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:35.919
is still a long way off.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.120
Where’s the Princess?

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.039
She hasn’t gotten up yet.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.159
I’ve called her many times.

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.599
Mister Xie, you’re here.

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:47.800
Xiao Yuan Yuan is here!

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:50.319
Xiao Yuan Yuan.

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:51.599
Where is he?

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.599
Princess.

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:53.919
Rong Heng tricked you.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.400
You’re something else.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.240
You’ve learned to lie.

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:32.439
Xiao Yuan Yuan.

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.520
Princess, you—

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.919
I’ll cook a meal for you.

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:37.199
Let’s go.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.719
Hurry.

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:04.599
Try this.

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:05.240
Okay.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.879
How is it?

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.639
It’s delicious.

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:41.319
It’s all right now.

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:55.120
You need to calm down.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.120
Take it slow.
