00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.800
Your child greets the Empress Mother.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.160
You may dispense with formalities.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.800
I summoned you both here today

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.359
to discuss matters regarding the Festival of Ingenuity.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.800
Princess Er has hosted it in previous years.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.719
She has always done an excellent job.

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.000
This year, Princess Er will assist Princess Royal in organizing.

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:39.799
Empress Mother,

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:42.200
I don't want to celebrate the Festival of Ingenuity.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.799
I'm not interested in those needlework activities.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:48.119
Why not let my sister handle it instead?

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.479
Nonsense!

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.560
The Festival of Ingenuity is a day to pray for a good harvest.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.719
How can you treat it so lightly?

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:57.119
You hold the title of Princess Royal.

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.759
You should bless the people.

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:01.359
You must not shirk this duty.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.599
Yes.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:05.719
I will obey your command.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.799
Princess Er,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.879
Princess Royal knows little of the festival's details.

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:13.560
Starting tomorrow,

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:15.959
teach her the Festival of Ingenuity procedures.

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:17.920
Be thorough and precise.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.480
No mistakes are allowed.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.159
Yes.

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:22.920
Empress Mother,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.239
I will do my best to assist my sister.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.480
We'll organize the Festival of Ingenuity well.

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:37.359
Greetings, Princess.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:39.599
Hello, Sister.

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:42.000
What are you two doing?

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.200
Who drank this water?

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:47.280
It smells bad now.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.040
Sister,

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.959
On the fifth of the seventh month,

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.599
the Festival of Ingenuity features the Needle-Floating Skill Test.

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:58.959
Women place bowls of water in the sun.

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:00.159
After a while,

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.280
a film forms on the water's surface.

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:02.560
This embroidery needle,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.799
when dropped in, will float.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.799
Look at the shadow on the water's bottom.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.199
If it forms shapes of clouds, flowers, birds, or beasts,

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:10.599
Enough, enough, enough!

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.759
Stop with the fancy talk.

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:12.560
I don't like listening to it.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.919
Threading needles, year after year, with neighbors.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.120
Testing one's skill and spirit with the needle.

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:24.960
Who alone sees the shadow of the dragon shuttle?

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.400
Embroidering mandarin ducks, yet not crossing paths.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.360
Needle-Floating Skill Test.

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:31.560
It seeks not only skillful hands,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.719
but also a perfect match in secret.

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.080
What are you two talking about?

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.159
I have no idea what you're saying.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.879
But

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.800
this perfect match

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.719
sounds rather interesting to me.

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.879
Why are there needles stuck in this potato?

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.960
On the night of the Festival,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.120
one must face the moon

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.560
and thread needles continuously.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.159
Whoever threads fastest is deemed skillful.

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.680
She becomes this year's clever maiden.

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.039
That's impressive.

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.800
What's the point, really?

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.800
All these pointless things.

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:25.520
Little Yuanyuan,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.960
come here!

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.919
Princess,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.240
you called me?

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.080
Give me your hand.

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:32.680
What for?

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.479
To dye your fingernails.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.039
Dyeing fingernails?

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.919
That's right.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.960
How can a grown man dye his fingernails?

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:40.840
All men in Jin City dye their fingernails.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.680
I won't.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.560
Sit down.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.879
Did you forget you made me eat radish and I had an allergy?

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:48.319
I pleaded with the Empress Mother for you.

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.199
I saved your life.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.960
If you agree to dye your fingernails,

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.960
this incident

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.960
I'll let it go.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.919
Fine.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.360
You promised, remember.

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:58.919
That's more like it.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.199
Don't move.

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:07.879
It'll be done soon.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.959
Done.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.600
The color is about right now.

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:25.199
Young Master Xie,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.000
my sister loves to joke.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.360
Please don't hold it against her.

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.160
Princess Er is always gentle and wise.

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:34.279
She truly understands people.

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:45.079
Little Yuanyuan,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.800
Princess,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.759
why are you here?

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.800
Today, the imperial kitchen

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.879
prepared many pastries bought outside the palace.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.680
I found them quite delicious.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.480
So I brought some for you to try.

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:57.600
I didn't expect you to be so thoughtful.

00:04:58.759 --> 00:04:59.759
Actually,

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:02.160
I've been thinking a lot lately.

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.279
Instead of opposing you,

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.360
I'd rather stay in the palace peacefully.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.079
And live with you.

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:11.480
Little Yuanyuan,

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.240
That's the right way to think.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.399
Just stay by my side obediently,

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:18.319
and I promise you'll be well treated.

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.000
After the Festival of Ingenuity,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.000
I'll ask the Empress Mother to grant us marriage.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.160
Marriage?

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.000
Isn't that too soon?

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:28.839
What,

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:29.800
you don't want to?

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.519
No,

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.800
I just think

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.319
we should have a romantic date first.

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:38.199
Then talk about marriage.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.120
A romantic date?

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.680
Look,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.399
the Festival of Ingenuity is coming soon.

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:47.680
Festival of Ingenuity

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.160
is a day for couples in love to go on dates.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.160
I heard that in Jin City,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.399
there are grand events outside the palace.

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:55.519
Princess, could you

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:56.600
take me there too?

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.160
Let it be our date.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.879
It'll add material to my Yuan Yuan Chronicle.

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:01.759
What do you think, Princess?

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.560
Good idea!

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.600
Perfect timing.

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:08.240
I've never

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.920
attended the Festival of Ingenuity outside the palace.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.199
Alright.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.120
After the palace events are done,

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:15.759
we'll go out together for our date.

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:17.560
Okay.
