00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.679
Don't worry, Gongzhu.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.160
It's all right.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.239
Gongzhu.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.120
How is it?

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.039
Did you find him?

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.640
Search for him.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.960
Dig everywhere if you must.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.399
You must bring him to me.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.920
Yes.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.679
Please don't worry, Gongzhu.

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:34.679
That boy Xie Yuan—

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:36.039
If we can't find him, so be it.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.719
In the future,

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.320
won't we still serve you?

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:38.960
Right?

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.079
Who do you think you are?

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.320
You dare mention Xiao Yuan to me?

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:43.560
Deliver my command.

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.240
Expel all officials from the palace.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.799
Leave none behind.

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:48.159
Steaming hot buns.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.960
Would you like one?

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.159
Fresh from the oven.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.000
They're delicious.

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:53.479
I'll have one.

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.159
I'm not hungry.

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:57.399
Bun.

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.560
Freshly baked bun.

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.000
Gongzhu has given an order.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.719
Find this person.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:09.680
A great reward awaits.

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:12.680
Steaming hot buns.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.799
Straw hat.

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:15.200
Take a look at the straw hat.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.799
It's really nice.

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.760
Freshly baked bun.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.640
Gongzhu.

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:28.879
Please, Gongzhu.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.840
What's wrong with our Gongzhu?

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.719
She probably wants to drive us all out.

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.000
She wants everyone gone.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.079
Forgive us.

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:36.680
Please, Gongzhu.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:37.640
Gongzhu.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.879
Forgive Xiang'er.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.879
Xiao Tao.

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:43.120
What's all the commotion outside?

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:44.560
Gongzhu.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.719
It's Zhao Xiang and the others.

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:47.120
They're all kneeling outside the palace gate.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.400
They insist on staying.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.200
Forgive us, Gongzhu.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.040
Enough.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.680
They've served me for years.

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:54.920
They're quite pitiful.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.000
Let them stay.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.040
Yes.

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:06.400
Young master.

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:07.719
Are you just leaving like this?

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:08.639
What about Ruo Lin?

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.319
You can go find her.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.280
Who are you?

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:22.520
I...

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.840
I'm here to see the second Gongzhu.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.000
Our young master and your second Gongzhu

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:28.280
are good friends.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.879
Get out!

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.840
You don't belong here.

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.120
Don't blame us for being rude.

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:39.599
Second Gongzhu.

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:41.039
I'm Ruo Lin.

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.560
You're with Xie Yuan. Leave!

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.080
Second Gongzhu.

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.879
I'm with Xie Yuan!

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:46.840
I'm Ruo Lin!

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.319
Who's outside?

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.280
Why all the noise?

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.520
Reporting to Gongzhu,

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:54.199
it's Xie Yuan's attendant.

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:55.240
His name is Ruo Lin.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.840
He's asking you to let him leave the palace.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.039
Should I go drive him away?

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.840
Wait.

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.599
Take him away.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.719
Treat him well.

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:05.520
Yes.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.400
Sister.

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.000
Are you worried about Xie Yuan?

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.520
There's still no news of him.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.400
What should I do?

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:38.879
Don't worry, sister.

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.840
If Ruo Lin, Xie Yuan's attendant, is paraded,

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.479
Xie Yuan will surely appear.

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:47.719
And Ruo Lin is in your palace now.

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:57.800
Who is it?

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.879
They're beheading someone!

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.240
Look, someone's being executed!

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.240
I heard they caught a Yue spy in the palace.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.680
He'll be executed at noon.

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:07.639
Yue spy.

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.840
Ruo Lin.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.199
Young master.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.199
Ruo Lin will go first.

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:19.480
If there's another life,

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.480
Ruo Lin will still follow you.

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:23.480
GONGZHU ARRIVES.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.920
Everyone, rise.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.600
Today, I will witness the execution myself.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.800
It's to

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:38.319
show Jin Guo's national power.

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:41.000
The person before you

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.360
is truly

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.560
a Yue spy.

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:45.319
Guilty of unforgivable crimes.

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:46.720
Full of cunning schemes.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.959
If not executed,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.480
the people's anger won't be calmed.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.879
Execute! Execute!

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:52.839
Stop!

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:53.639
Execute!

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.879
Xie Yuan.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.879
Young master.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.079
Why are you here?

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:00.279
Are you all right?

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.160
I'm fine.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.600
Gongzhu.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.399
You say he's a spy.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.439
Do you have proof?

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:12.439
How dare you!

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.040
My word is proof enough.

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:17.319
Xie Yuan.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.319
You think I'll release him just because you came?

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.240
You underestimate me.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.000
You approached me first.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.519
You tricked me out of the palace.

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.480
I didn't expect it was all a lie.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.120
If you want me to release him, I can.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.040
Cut off your own legs

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:44.199
and I'll let him go.

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:46.240
Young master, you mustn't!

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:50.000
It's fine.

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:51.199
I know what I'm doing.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.800
Gongzhu

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.639
Just to vent your anger,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.079
you want my legs,

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:01.399
and others' lives.

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:04.079
Then I think Jin Guo's people won't live long.

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:06.879
Because in your eyes,

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.639
our lives are worthless.

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:12.279
Do you know why everyone fears you?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.120
Because you don't value their lives.

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:16.319
Isn't that right, everyone?

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.319
Yeah, aren't our lives lives too?

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:20.439
Let him go! Let Xie Yuan go!

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:23.319
Let him go! Let him go!

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:24.079
Let him go!

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:24.680
Quiet.

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:26.600
I can let him go,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.480
but you two

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.920
must return to the palace with me.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.199
Alright.

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:35.480
I promise you.

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:38.879
Release him now.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.920
Take them back to the palace.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.480
You've suffered.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.439
Young master.

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:46.720
Ruo Lin is fine.

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:48.079
Let's go.
