TWO YEARS AGO

00:00:38.726 --> 00:00:41.229
I'm all packed, but…

00:00:41.312 --> 00:00:42.689
I'm still thinking about it.

00:00:42.772 --> 00:00:43.606
DAD

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.526
Thinking about what?
Weren't you coming back to Korea?

00:00:47.318 --> 00:00:48.653
I just need a plan.

00:00:49.153 --> 00:00:50.738
This summer had to be different.

00:00:52.782 --> 00:00:56.202
Last summer,
the rainy season was pretty long.

00:00:59.622 --> 00:01:03.251
The sky was always gloomy,
so I couldn't see any stars at all.

00:01:04.377 --> 00:01:08.173
It was the hottest,
most boring summer of my life.

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.134
Was it all because

00:01:11.885 --> 00:01:14.971
I couldn't finish my 100th war
with Ha-gyeong?

00:01:18.308 --> 00:01:19.142
ONE YEAR AGO

00:01:19.225 --> 00:01:20.268
In your name? Now?

00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:24.063
No, soon. Ha-gyeong will ask for
the power of attorney. Do it then.

00:01:24.147 --> 00:01:25.273
Please upload this file.

00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:27.650
You're worried Ha-gyeong
might sell the peanut house?

00:01:28.318 --> 00:01:30.987
I just won't give her
the power of attorney.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.866
Then she'd have to fight with you, Dad.
That'd only make things harder for her.

00:01:36.284 --> 00:01:38.786
You're the only adult
she has left around her.

00:01:39.412 --> 00:01:42.206
If she fights with you,
how do you think she'd feel?

00:01:45.543 --> 00:01:47.921
She needs to fight with me.

00:01:53.092 --> 00:01:55.720
I've lived in this town for 17 years.

00:01:56.471 --> 00:01:58.765
I'm sure you can make it happen too.

00:01:58.848 --> 00:02:00.516
June in Seoul is still warming up.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.684
We can do it!

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:07.273
This year, it might be hotter than summer.

00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:09.651
But by July,

00:02:10.818 --> 00:02:12.987
summer in Patan
will get pretty extreme too.

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:17.533
I have no choice
but to prepare thoroughly.

00:02:18.785 --> 00:02:22.664
Even if something unexpected happens,
it's okay.

00:02:24.791 --> 00:02:27.085
I came prepared to get hurt, at least.

00:02:28.544 --> 00:02:32.257
TWO YEARS AGO

00:02:37.136 --> 00:02:38.471
Baek Do-young died, didn't he?

00:02:40.098 --> 00:02:41.557
That was a year ago.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.395
Right?

00:02:51.234 --> 00:02:55.530
Why did you… pretend to be Do-young?

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.199
What's the reason?

00:02:59.117 --> 00:03:02.912
Why did you pretend to be Baek Do-young,
write letters, send emails,

00:03:03.788 --> 00:03:05.999
and even talk to me on the phone? Why?

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:09.002
MAIN BUDDHA HALL

00:03:09.085 --> 00:03:10.837
How could you do this to me?

00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:13.464
Say something, Baek Do-ha.

00:03:14.507 --> 00:03:18.720
Say something! At least make an excuse!

00:03:20.138 --> 00:03:22.807
The result of trying hard
to keep anyone from getting hurt…

00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:25.435
was just this.

00:03:25.518 --> 00:03:27.061
Let's never see each other again.

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:32.900
So you resent me…

00:03:35.028 --> 00:03:36.446
this summer.

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.991
I'll spend this summer…

00:03:41.326 --> 00:03:42.535
liking you.

00:03:47.832 --> 00:03:50.001
My 100th war with Ha-gyeong…

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.837
has finally begun well.

00:03:54.464 --> 00:03:55.298
What did you say?

00:03:56.424 --> 00:03:59.969
There's no one else you can hate but me.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.347
Because I'm the only one left.

00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:05.683
So hate me all you want.

00:04:06.642 --> 00:04:07.477
By my side.

00:04:09.395 --> 00:04:11.189
I'll do what I want too.

00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:13.066
That's you liking me?

00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:17.487
You do what you want. I'll do what I want.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.114
Let's try enduring it.

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:22.992
You crazy bastard.

00:04:23.076 --> 00:04:25.703
Being crazy
is better than regretting all day.

00:04:27.288 --> 00:04:29.499
Two years of just waiting…

00:04:32.168 --> 00:04:33.920
and doing nothing is enough.

00:04:50.728 --> 00:04:51.896
Want to watch it together?

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.773
TAKING CARE OF SU-BAK

00:04:53.856 --> 00:04:57.276
"Su-bak cries a lot,
so wash his face often…"

00:05:03.533 --> 00:05:04.867
Hey, Su-bak!

00:05:05.743 --> 00:05:07.412
Where did your mom go?

00:05:07.954 --> 00:05:12.083
It's not even July yet,
but the weather is extreme already.

00:05:13.376 --> 00:05:14.585
And in the end…

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:18.423
Song Ha-gyeong left the peanut house.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.228
PROJECT TRANSFER REQUEST FORM

00:05:40.945 --> 00:05:42.488
I have something to tell you.

00:05:45.616 --> 00:05:46.826
Are you kidding me?

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:51.956
You made such a fuss last time
to impress the mayor,

00:05:52.498 --> 00:05:53.875
and now you want to quit?

00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:57.670
Cheontan Senior Center and the Disabled
Welfare Center haven't been completed.

00:05:57.753 --> 00:05:58.754
I'll take those on.

00:06:00.214 --> 00:06:03.759
Considering you love the attention,
I got you the perfect position

00:06:04.302 --> 00:06:06.888
and now you're changing your mind?

00:06:06.971 --> 00:06:09.223
I won't fire you
even if you don't pull this stunt.

00:06:09.307 --> 00:06:10.558
-Please stop--
-No!

00:06:11.517 --> 00:06:12.935
I'm serious. Please fire me.

00:06:14.395 --> 00:06:16.772
Song Ha-gyeong, what are you--

00:06:21.777 --> 00:06:23.613
Yes, this is Manager Jeon Ye-eun.

00:06:24.155 --> 00:06:26.574
Yes, I understand. Bye.

00:06:30.661 --> 00:06:33.789
Stop talking and follow me.
The mayor's asking for you.

00:06:37.001 --> 00:06:39.462
-Hello, sir.
-Come, have a seat.

00:06:41.464 --> 00:06:42.298
Hello.

00:06:46.552 --> 00:06:47.762
What are you doing?

00:06:49.472 --> 00:06:50.306
All right.

00:06:53.851 --> 00:06:57.230
Director Baek won the grand prize
at the Seoul Architecture Awards,

00:06:57.313 --> 00:06:59.273
and Ms. Song is a graduate
of Patan High.

00:06:59.774 --> 00:07:03.486
I have high expectations
for the synergy you'll create.

00:07:05.696 --> 00:07:09.075
The only high school
in Patan-myeon shut down,

00:07:09.158 --> 00:07:10.451
so it was all over the news.

00:07:11.244 --> 00:07:14.330
Keep the public and media on track
without any noise,

00:07:14.413 --> 00:07:16.707
and do a good job, okay?

00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:20.002
The project wraps up next month,
right around your re-election, sir.

00:07:20.586 --> 00:07:23.881
Winning the architecture award
before the re-election would be perfect.

00:07:23.965 --> 00:07:26.217
I'm really looking forward to this.

00:07:27.093 --> 00:07:31.931
Anyway, I hope
everyone will support Director Baek.

00:07:32.348 --> 00:07:33.391
Power!

00:07:34.976 --> 00:07:36.561
-Power!
-Power!

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:38.646
Power.

00:07:39.188 --> 00:07:40.147
Power.

00:07:46.112 --> 00:07:47.446
Things aren't going your way?

00:07:53.619 --> 00:07:54.870
TRANSFER REQUEST FORM

00:07:54.954 --> 00:07:58.499
Did you say you wanted to quit
because it didn't work out?

00:08:02.628 --> 00:08:06.048
It's been three days. You want me
to bring you some stuff you need?

00:08:06.591 --> 00:08:08.009
You left your tablet too.

00:08:09.093 --> 00:08:11.095
-You went to Seul's house?
-That's--

00:08:12.221 --> 00:08:14.015
-Ms. Song?
-Hello.

00:08:16.726 --> 00:08:19.979
Mr. Baek,
as you know, this is a public space.

00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:22.898
I'd appreciate it if you spoke formally.

00:08:22.982 --> 00:08:24.442
The space ratio--

00:08:24.525 --> 00:08:28.237
The green zone appears limited,
but it meets the Pacheon building codes.

00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:34.410
Tourists and staff
need to have separate routes.

00:08:34.493 --> 00:08:36.829
That's indicated
in the detailed design plans.

00:08:37.663 --> 00:08:39.582
I just resent the file to you.

00:08:50.926 --> 00:08:53.596
Want to see the elevations?
You might get something out of it.

00:08:55.348 --> 00:08:59.644
As for this budget,
the design fee is set below the average.

00:09:00.186 --> 00:09:02.938
I'll get back to you regarding that issue.

00:09:07.735 --> 00:09:11.572
Ha-gyeong, you have to work with me
face-to-face till you're sick of it.

00:09:12.323 --> 00:09:14.659
So stop questioning my feelings.

00:09:14.742 --> 00:09:16.160
Let's face it fair and square.

00:09:26.754 --> 00:09:27.963
You must be insane.

00:09:29.298 --> 00:09:31.509
Hey, Song, how much did you drink?

00:09:32.301 --> 00:09:34.220
-Seul.
-What's up?

00:09:34.303 --> 00:09:35.763
You've been sober for a year.

00:09:35.846 --> 00:09:39.475
Hey, stop drinking.
Stop, you troublemaker!

00:09:39.558 --> 00:09:41.102
-Hey!
-Seriously!

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.400
Get it together.

00:09:47.483 --> 00:09:49.318
-Hey.
-Take off your shoes.

00:09:50.194 --> 00:09:53.072
Why am I so shaken up

00:09:53.155 --> 00:09:57.660
by some American puppy's tricks?

00:09:57.743 --> 00:10:02.873
For him, lawsuits and work
are all just simple games.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.088
When he leaves,

00:10:10.297 --> 00:10:12.675
I'll be alone again.

00:10:17.096 --> 00:10:21.058
Work and home are a mess right now.

00:10:30.818 --> 00:10:33.696
Stop questioning
and let's face it fair and square.

00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:35.614
Fair and square.

00:10:36.449 --> 00:10:40.494
No! Hey, Song Ha-gyeong!

00:10:41.912 --> 00:10:45.875
Hey, why did you leave your own house
because of that jerk?

00:10:47.376 --> 00:10:50.379
-Hey, why did you--
-Don't.

00:10:50.463 --> 00:10:52.381
Why give up a 12-billion-won project?

00:10:52.465 --> 00:10:54.508
It'd be easier if that jerk quit.

00:10:55.718 --> 00:10:56.927
Don't throw things.

00:10:57.011 --> 00:10:58.179
I'll make sure…

00:10:58.763 --> 00:11:00.431
he knows who's in charge.

00:11:00.514 --> 00:11:02.016
Why are you throwing a bag?

00:11:02.099 --> 00:11:03.142
You're going to…

00:11:04.143 --> 00:11:07.271
leave this place before long, you drifter!

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.523
You bastard!

00:11:11.817 --> 00:11:12.776
It hurts.

00:11:14.403 --> 00:11:15.821
Seul, it hurts.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.407
MOTHER-IN-LAW'S KIMCHI STEW

00:11:22.036 --> 00:11:23.537

PATAN-MYEON VILLAGE HEADS' ASSOCIATION
PAVENGERS

00:11:54.026 --> 00:11:57.446
Village heads, as you can see,

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.366
an outsider architect
is trying to change our school.

00:12:00.991 --> 00:12:03.160
Village heads,
you're so devoted to our school.

00:12:03.244 --> 00:12:06.705
I know you'd oppose it
even if I don't mention it,

00:12:06.789 --> 00:12:08.749
but I brought you here just in case.

00:12:10.334 --> 00:12:13.754
By the way, Song is dining out in Patan.

00:12:13.837 --> 00:12:18.092
You all love
this Mother-in-law's kimchi stew.

00:12:18.175 --> 00:12:19.218
It's delicious.

00:12:19.885 --> 00:12:22.471
Shall we enjoy our meal then?

00:12:23.889 --> 00:12:25.558
Eat up. It'll get cold.

00:12:32.481 --> 00:12:35.234
SAT - VILLAGE HEADS' MEETING
SUN - WOMEN'S ASSOC. AZALEA WINE

00:12:35.317 --> 00:12:37.152
Gotta admit, I'm a genius.

00:12:37.736 --> 00:12:43.659
Why should this genius leave?
I'll make you leave. Just wait.

00:12:43.742 --> 00:12:46.620
Tae-young,
we need to spread out these panels.

00:12:46.704 --> 00:12:49.415
-This side?
-The colors don't match the surrounding.

00:12:49.498 --> 00:12:50.708
Try making it again.

00:12:52.418 --> 00:12:53.502
SONG HA-GYEONG

00:13:00.884 --> 00:13:03.721
Yes, Ms. Song.
I was just about to call you.

00:13:03.804 --> 00:13:08.058
I set the date for the town hall meeting.
It's tomorrow. Can you make it?

00:13:08.976 --> 00:13:12.354
The sooner the better. Thank you.
See you tomorrow.

00:13:14.857 --> 00:13:16.108
What?

00:13:16.775 --> 00:13:19.820
Hey, you have that town hall plan file
I sent before, right?

00:13:19.903 --> 00:13:20.779
Pull it up quick.

00:13:20.863 --> 00:13:23.616
Are you really going to do it?

00:13:24.241 --> 00:13:25.659
Hey, Director Baek.

00:13:25.743 --> 00:13:28.829
If we're going to do it, do it right.
No regrets.

00:13:29.705 --> 00:13:31.290
What? Where?

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.339
PATAN MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION

00:13:38.422 --> 00:13:39.965
PATAN WOMEN'S ASSOCIATION

00:13:40.049 --> 00:13:41.508
What's all this?

00:13:49.183 --> 00:13:51.810
-I want to finish it all at once.
-What?

00:13:51.894 --> 00:13:55.189
I know revising the budget
is a headache for you.

00:13:55.773 --> 00:13:59.902
I'll complete the schedule you spent
the whole week on in just one day. I will.

00:14:06.575 --> 00:14:09.703
-Hello!
-Hello!

00:14:09.787 --> 00:14:12.706
Ladies and gentlemen of the Council,

00:14:13.791 --> 00:14:15.125
and our honored merchants,

00:14:16.251 --> 00:14:18.671
-what day is today?
-Azalea wine brewing day!

00:14:18.754 --> 00:14:20.631
This is a village festival.

00:14:20.714 --> 00:14:23.842
Since it's hosted at
the Women's Association president's place,

00:14:23.926 --> 00:14:26.637
I set up some parasols for you all.

00:14:30.307 --> 00:14:32.726
All right, ladies.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.104
Remove the calyx and toss it over here.

00:14:35.187 --> 00:14:36.855
Leave the stamens as they are.

00:14:36.939 --> 00:14:38.607
-Okay.
-You're doing great.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:44.905
Wait, this isn't right.
Why am I picking calyxes here?

00:14:45.906 --> 00:14:46.740
It's hot.

00:14:46.824 --> 00:14:48.367
Hot!

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.203
It's nice and spacious,
but the heat's the problem.

00:14:51.286 --> 00:14:55.666
My goodness,
Madam President, are you hot? Wear this.

00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:57.668
It's cool.

00:14:58.168 --> 00:14:59.712
I'll bring something to drink.

00:15:00.587 --> 00:15:02.423
-I'm hot too!
-Got it.

00:15:04.174 --> 00:15:06.010
This spot needs to dry completely.

00:15:06.093 --> 00:15:08.971
-Here, have a drink.
-Thank you.

00:15:09.054 --> 00:15:09.888
Thank you.

00:15:10.431 --> 00:15:13.183
-I didn't get one.
-I'll bring you one.

00:15:14.393 --> 00:15:17.563
Since it's hot, our Dr. Song
should say a few cool words.

00:15:19.064 --> 00:15:20.566
-Me?
-Yes.

00:15:23.235 --> 00:15:24.194
Applause!

00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:33.537
Yes, these azalea petals you're trimming

00:15:33.662 --> 00:15:35.456
will be used to brew
traditional liquor…

00:15:35.539 --> 00:15:38.751
-Dugyeonju!
-It'll be used to make dugyeonju.

00:15:38.834 --> 00:15:41.754
Every year,
the Women's Association holds this event,

00:15:41.837 --> 00:15:45.674
removing the calyxes
from these azalea flowers.

00:15:45.758 --> 00:15:47.593
Is everyone enjoying themselves?

00:15:47.676 --> 00:15:49.470
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:15:50.679 --> 00:15:55.559
Ms. Song,
they say Patan has lots of azalea flowers.

00:15:55.642 --> 00:15:57.936
How many would there be in total?
A thousand?

00:15:59.396 --> 00:16:01.899
Roughly speaking, about a million?

00:16:01.982 --> 00:16:02.858
-Yes.
-Right?

00:16:02.941 --> 00:16:04.526
That's so many.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:08.238
My favorite K-pop song
is "A Million Roses".

00:16:08.322 --> 00:16:09.990
Then sing it!

00:16:10.074 --> 00:16:11.241
Sing it!

00:16:11.325 --> 00:16:12.701
Sing it!

00:16:12.785 --> 00:16:13.994
Sing it!

00:16:14.078 --> 00:16:17.122
He's an architect.
You can't make him sing.

00:16:18.165 --> 00:16:19.750
Madam President, you can't!

00:16:21.418 --> 00:16:25.923
Long ago, on some star

00:16:26.006 --> 00:16:29.426
When I came into this world

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:31.303
Oh, my, he sings so well.

00:16:31.386 --> 00:16:34.598
I heard a small voice

00:16:35.474 --> 00:16:40.229
Telling me to give love

00:16:40.312 --> 00:16:41.480
Great!

00:16:41.563 --> 00:16:44.775
Without hate, without hate
Without a hateful heart

00:16:44.858 --> 00:16:45.692
So cool!

00:16:45.776 --> 00:16:46.735
All together!

00:16:47.236 --> 00:16:52.032
Generously, generously,
When I only give love

00:16:53.033 --> 00:16:58.163
A million flowers, a million flowers
A million flowers will bloom

00:16:58.664 --> 00:17:03.544
And I can go to my longed-for
Beautiful star

00:17:04.962 --> 00:17:05.796
Applause!

00:17:08.215 --> 00:17:09.174
What's with him?

00:17:09.258 --> 00:17:11.593
Madam President,
please don't make me sing.

00:17:12.886 --> 00:17:14.680
He's really lost it.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.807
-Thank you, as always.
-Enjoy it.

00:17:22.646 --> 00:17:25.274
Director Baek is usually like that.

00:17:25.357 --> 00:17:26.650
Today he's extra pumped up.

00:17:26.733 --> 00:17:27.651
I'll get going.

00:17:29.653 --> 00:17:32.364
-You must be flustered.
-I'm fine.

00:17:33.073 --> 00:17:35.075
-The real show's next.
-Exactly.

00:17:35.993 --> 00:17:38.078
Where's next? Let's go.

00:17:55.888 --> 00:17:57.806
But clearly, there are no trees here.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:00.058
The school used to be
full of lush boxwood trees.

00:18:00.767 --> 00:18:03.979
Sir, there normally aren't any trees
next to the observatory

00:18:04.062 --> 00:18:05.564
because it'd block the view.

00:18:05.647 --> 00:18:07.482
We're planning to transplant them.

00:18:07.566 --> 00:18:10.444
What? Pull out the school's trees?

00:18:11.028 --> 00:18:15.991
Why pull them out? Why?
Don't you know the Patan spirit?

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:20.204
The evergreen trees
That are green all year

00:18:20.287 --> 00:18:23.790
Like the hearts of Patan people

00:18:23.874 --> 00:18:27.002
Round sky and round village

00:18:27.544 --> 00:18:29.963
Living with mountains and valleys

00:18:30.047 --> 00:18:30.964
Heave-ho!

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.010
Patan

00:18:35.093 --> 00:18:37.846
Eternal cradle

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:42.226
Let's embrace the clear spirit

00:18:42.309 --> 00:18:44.895
Our Patan High School

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:51.610
Anyway, that's the spirit of this school.

00:18:51.693 --> 00:18:54.029
What batch were you in?
Don't you even know that?

00:18:55.322 --> 00:18:57.074
Well, I…

00:18:57.157 --> 00:18:58.951
The director isn't from Pacheon.

00:19:00.953 --> 00:19:02.704
He's not even Korean. He's American.

00:19:04.248 --> 00:19:06.708
He's not from Patan High,

00:19:07.251 --> 00:19:10.295
let alone Pacheon-si. It won't be easy.

00:19:10.379 --> 00:19:13.423
All the contractors and
construction companies are Pacheon locals.

00:19:13.507 --> 00:19:15.342
How will you communicate?

00:19:15.425 --> 00:19:17.010
You can't! No way!

00:19:17.094 --> 00:19:21.556
Even I, with dugyeonju and soybean noodle
soup running through my veins,

00:19:22.099 --> 00:19:24.476
can't mess with Patan High.
Absolutely not.

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:25.769
No chance!

00:19:25.852 --> 00:19:27.145
I already met the companies.

00:19:27.229 --> 00:19:29.523
And, sir,
I eat soybean noodle soup every day too.

00:19:31.108 --> 00:19:31.942
No triangles!

00:19:32.693 --> 00:19:35.445
Since ancient times,
round things are the sky.

00:19:36.113 --> 00:19:38.031
Square things are the earth. Get it?

00:19:38.115 --> 00:19:41.868
That's why our Patan-myeon
is surrounded by mountains.

00:19:41.952 --> 00:19:44.663
The land is round, the houses are square.

00:19:45.163 --> 00:19:48.375
So there's harmony
between heaven and earth.

00:19:48.458 --> 00:19:52.587
That's the kind of village it is.
But here…

00:19:55.048 --> 00:19:56.341
you want to build a triangle?

00:19:56.425 --> 00:19:57.801
Nice!

00:20:00.512 --> 00:20:01.763
Goodbye, Baek Do-ha.

00:20:02.723 --> 00:20:06.101
Village Head Go,
if you looked at the proposal,

00:20:06.184 --> 00:20:08.979
the building itself isn't triangular.
It's just the internal--

00:20:10.605 --> 00:20:13.275
You don't get it.

00:20:13.358 --> 00:20:14.693
-Let's wrap this up.
-Right.

00:20:14.776 --> 00:20:17.696
-Go, everyone go.
-Pointless.

00:20:17.779 --> 00:20:18.905
What's he talking about?

00:20:18.989 --> 00:20:21.950
Ms. Song. What did you do?

00:20:22.034 --> 00:20:26.079
Being a Patan native,
you should've stopped this sooner.

00:20:27.873 --> 00:20:30.375
-I'm sorry!
-Dr. Song, I'm disappointed.

00:20:32.127 --> 00:20:32.961
Wait!

00:20:36.923 --> 00:20:37.841
Please.

00:20:40.594 --> 00:20:41.720
Gentlemen,

00:20:42.637 --> 00:20:45.724
before coming here,
I met the Women's Association president.

00:20:46.475 --> 00:20:48.518
This one's just for you.

00:20:56.735 --> 00:20:57.569
Patan-myeon…

00:20:59.279 --> 00:21:01.740
is most famous
for dugyeonju made from azaleas.

00:21:02.366 --> 00:21:06.036
Isn't this the special edition?

00:21:06.119 --> 00:21:08.997
The one the president only brings out
on holidays.

00:21:09.498 --> 00:21:12.626
Brewed only with spring water
collected on Dano Day. One sip,

00:21:13.293 --> 00:21:15.462
and you feel Patan's spring. That liquor!

00:21:16.004 --> 00:21:18.382
No way, this must be fake.

00:21:18.465 --> 00:21:22.803
Someone from Seoul, especially
an American, couldn't haven gotten this.

00:21:22.886 --> 00:21:26.139
You'll know if it's real
once you taste it.

00:21:29.309 --> 00:21:30.936
-It's real.
-Real?

00:21:31.019 --> 00:21:32.646
-Really real?
-Yeah.

00:21:32.729 --> 00:21:35.774
There are a few more bottles.
Want to sit and talk about Patan High?

00:21:35.857 --> 00:21:37.359
-Sure.
-Get the glasses.

00:21:37.442 --> 00:21:39.736
Village Heads?

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.113
Get the glasses.

00:21:43.031 --> 00:21:44.699
-Village Head.
-Sir, have a seat.

00:21:44.783 --> 00:21:46.118
Let's take our time and talk.

00:21:47.577 --> 00:21:50.956
This isn't right. Just for a moment…

00:21:51.623 --> 00:21:52.874
Let's go.

00:22:02.634 --> 00:22:03.510
Cheers! Me too.

00:22:05.512 --> 00:22:07.472
Aren't you drinking too much?

00:22:08.432 --> 00:22:12.102
-What's up with you two?
-What about you, Madam President?

00:22:12.185 --> 00:22:14.563
Why did you give
that precious dugyeonju to him?

00:22:15.105 --> 00:22:18.108
You don't know about the azaleas disaster
caused by the floods.

00:22:18.733 --> 00:22:21.445
Everything we dried was ruined.

00:22:21.528 --> 00:22:24.865
That guy went all the way
to northern Gangwon just to pick azaleas.

00:22:25.407 --> 00:22:27.409
Without him,
there would've been no event.

00:22:34.082 --> 00:22:35.959
Thank you.

00:22:37.544 --> 00:22:40.255
Here's to Patan!

00:22:40.338 --> 00:22:41.923
-To Patan!
-To Patan!

00:22:43.091 --> 00:22:44.217
All right.

00:22:47.262 --> 00:22:48.555
Great!

00:22:49.598 --> 00:22:52.642
Gentlemen, you've seen it a lot,

00:22:53.143 --> 00:22:55.812
but the Summer Triangle is really bright.

00:22:56.438 --> 00:22:59.191
Long ago, people looked at
this constellation to find the way.

00:22:59.691 --> 00:23:03.945
Right. Sailors used it
for navigation, too.

00:23:04.029 --> 00:23:07.157
If people can visit this village
which is less than an hour from Seoul,

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.992
to see the stars,

00:23:09.075 --> 00:23:11.411
it'd be great for tourism.

00:23:12.245 --> 00:23:13.079
Wait…

00:23:16.791 --> 00:23:19.252
Now that I see you closely,
Ji-cheol's friend,

00:23:20.545 --> 00:23:22.464
you're Director Baek's son, right?

00:23:23.048 --> 00:23:25.467
-Yes.
-That's right.

00:23:25.967 --> 00:23:27.761
The one who was going to study
the stars,

00:23:27.844 --> 00:23:30.764
always climbing mountains at night,
that little troublemaker, right?

00:23:30.847 --> 00:23:31.806
Right.

00:23:32.307 --> 00:23:34.935
I haven't seen you for a while.

00:23:38.355 --> 00:23:40.565
I'm his younger brother.

00:23:40.649 --> 00:23:43.401
You'll see me often now.
I live in the peanut house.

00:23:45.362 --> 00:23:48.740
Then you're a resident of Patan.

00:23:48.823 --> 00:23:50.784
-Yes.
-What should we do? Just approve it?

00:23:53.411 --> 00:23:56.498
How can we decide village matters
while drinking?

00:23:57.457 --> 00:24:00.543
-Come on.
-That's true.

00:24:01.127 --> 00:24:06.925
I know you've studied Patan a lot,

00:24:07.008 --> 00:24:09.844
but what's really important?

00:24:10.512 --> 00:24:12.555
The residents' hearts.

00:24:13.723 --> 00:24:18.812
Have you made even one ally
in this town?

00:24:26.152 --> 00:24:29.489
If you're going to ruin it, why not
just hang out with the village heads?

00:24:29.572 --> 00:24:32.617
I'll eat the ruined ones. It's okay.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:37.205
Your mom did that too.
She always ate the ruined ones.

00:24:38.081 --> 00:24:40.709
Still, she picked flowers really well.

00:24:40.792 --> 00:24:43.378
Every spring,
your mom picked the most azaleas.

00:24:44.462 --> 00:24:47.590
I remember. I still have
three bottles of dugyeonju at home.

00:24:49.718 --> 00:24:53.763
Mom made them in advance
for me to take along when I got married.

00:24:53.847 --> 00:24:57.225
I helped with that too.
Your mom was terrible at cooking.

00:24:58.852 --> 00:25:01.354
But she had quick hands.

00:25:01.438 --> 00:25:05.483
She was great at picking azaleas,
go-stop, yut nori.

00:25:05.567 --> 00:25:09.404
Yeah, I learned all those games
from Mom.

00:25:09.487 --> 00:25:13.700
Back when your mom was alive,
she never missed a village event.

00:25:14.492 --> 00:25:17.662
It's been a while
since I've seen your face. Nice.

00:25:21.082 --> 00:25:22.751
What are you doing, Song Ha-gyeong?

00:25:22.834 --> 00:25:26.212
Why are you talking about Mom here
and making pancakes now?

00:25:30.425 --> 00:25:31.634
Let's decide with this.

00:25:32.761 --> 00:25:34.679
Village matters?

00:25:36.348 --> 00:25:42.562
Mr. President, even so,
this is too unfair for an American…

00:25:43.646 --> 00:25:44.481
Deal.

00:25:48.109 --> 00:25:49.194
But…

00:25:50.695 --> 00:25:52.781
can I bring someone
to be on my team?

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:56.326
Ms. Song,
stop eating ruined hwajeon.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.161
Team up with me.

00:25:59.954 --> 00:26:02.999
-What?
-You're good at this kind of thing.

00:26:03.083 --> 00:26:04.376
A showdown.

00:26:04.918 --> 00:26:06.252
Now!

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:12.175
So you're deciding whether to support
the observatory with yut nori?

00:26:12.258 --> 00:26:13.885
That's right.

00:26:13.968 --> 00:26:18.890
More importantly,
why am I on Director Baek's team?

00:26:19.849 --> 00:26:22.644
Ms. Song, are you not confident? Scared?

00:26:22.727 --> 00:26:25.480
How am I supposed to
go up against you all?

00:26:26.398 --> 00:26:28.650
And you can't settle village business
with yut nori…

00:26:29.442 --> 00:26:30.276
Let's just do it.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.986
Just try it.

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:34.114
-Do it.
-Okay, let's do it.

00:26:34.697 --> 00:26:36.783
-Unbelievable.
-This guy said deal!

00:26:38.368 --> 00:26:39.953
No, I can't do this. This is crazy.

00:26:40.036 --> 00:26:41.955
-Come on, Dr. Song, let's go!
-Try it once.

00:26:42.497 --> 00:26:43.957
Okay, let's see. Throw them.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.209
The fence removal is on the line too.

00:26:47.001 --> 00:26:50.171
Village Head Go said
if we don't play it seriously,

00:26:50.255 --> 00:26:52.257
he'll take back
the fence removal approval too.

00:26:55.176 --> 00:26:57.178
-Let's go.
-Okay, let's go.

00:26:59.806 --> 00:27:01.808
-Yut!
-Yut!

00:27:01.891 --> 00:27:04.894
Village Head Sim, you're doing great!

00:27:14.112 --> 00:27:16.197
Gae!

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.909
Hey, yut nori is so fun!

00:27:19.993 --> 00:27:22.495
-Madam President, gae, one, two.
-Do, gae.

00:27:22.579 --> 00:27:23.830
Right.

00:27:23.913 --> 00:27:26.458
Wasn't Dr. Song's mom
the goddess of yut nori?

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.211
She'd say "Mo!" and she got mo.
"Yut!" and she got yut.

00:27:30.295 --> 00:27:33.339
But Dr. Song,
you must take after your dad.

00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:41.222
Ae-jeong must be crying in heaven!

00:27:41.764 --> 00:27:44.893
The former yut nori champion

00:27:44.976 --> 00:27:48.813
is leaving!

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:53.485
-Our turn? Give us the yut.
-Here.

00:27:55.862 --> 00:27:56.696
Hey, rubber band!

00:28:01.576 --> 00:28:05.205
What should we do?
Dr. Song looks serious.

00:28:05.288 --> 00:28:07.457
Even if she plays seriously,

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.502
from now on, she needs mo, yut, mo
to catch up.

00:28:10.585 --> 00:28:12.003
No way they'll win today.

00:28:13.046 --> 00:28:13.880
Village heads…

00:28:16.174 --> 00:28:18.134
if I lose this game…

00:28:19.219 --> 00:28:20.845
can you handle me?

00:28:21.971 --> 00:28:23.181
What?

00:28:24.182 --> 00:28:26.392
Hold up. If I lose…

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:28.686
you sure you can deal with me?

00:28:30.438 --> 00:28:31.773
Oh, gosh.

00:28:32.815 --> 00:28:33.733
KNOCKDOWN

00:28:33.816 --> 00:28:35.276
I won!

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:06.224
It's mo.

00:29:08.393 --> 00:29:10.562
-Mo!
-Isn't this cheating?

00:29:11.729 --> 00:29:13.565
This almost came out as back-do.

00:29:13.648 --> 00:29:17.652
If it were back-do, I'd win right away.
Why would I cheat? Let's go.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:25.410
Here.

00:29:25.493 --> 00:29:26.578
Please.

00:29:26.661 --> 00:29:29.455
-Sir, we just need gae.
-Village Head Jo, rub your nose.

00:29:52.645 --> 00:29:54.063
-Back-do!
-Back-do!

00:29:54.147 --> 00:29:55.773
Back-do!

00:29:58.151 --> 00:29:59.360
It is okay!

00:29:59.444 --> 00:30:00.987
-Our turn? Yes.
-It's fine!

00:30:01.821 --> 00:30:02.655
Good luck.

00:30:06.159 --> 00:30:07.452
Please, really.

00:30:26.971 --> 00:30:28.264
-Mo!
-Mo!

00:30:28.348 --> 00:30:29.974
-Mo!
-Mo!

00:30:30.058 --> 00:30:31.976
-We won!
-Mo!

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.164
She's finally back.

00:30:54.415 --> 00:30:57.502
The Song Ha-gyeong I knew.

00:31:01.547 --> 00:31:05.134
For a moment,
I became my old self again.

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.637
Because of Baek Do-ha.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.113
What exactly are you trying to do?

00:31:29.826 --> 00:31:32.412
Let's go. You're going home
to get your tablet, right?

00:31:32.996 --> 00:31:34.163
Hurry. We'll miss the bus.

00:31:36.416 --> 00:31:37.375
Hurry up.

00:31:40.586 --> 00:31:42.588
Dr. Song's back. It's been a while.

00:31:43.756 --> 00:31:46.509
You're still getting lots of love
from the elders.

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:48.720
What's your deal?

00:31:50.471 --> 00:31:52.181
What were you thinking all day today?

00:31:53.683 --> 00:31:57.520
Ms. Song, you made this plan.

00:31:58.104 --> 00:32:01.232
You participated in yut nori,
won in the end,

00:32:01.315 --> 00:32:04.152
and got the village heads' consent
all by yourself.

00:32:06.195 --> 00:32:09.699
Seeing you having a blast
after such a long time made me happy.

00:32:14.412 --> 00:32:17.248
To deal with Ha-gyeong,
I need to be this prepared.

00:32:17.915 --> 00:32:20.043
I came back fully prepared.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.505
"He only shows up for summer vacation
and doesn't even stay the whole month.

00:32:25.882 --> 00:32:28.092
He won't follow through this time either."

00:32:29.469 --> 00:32:30.595
These were your thoughts?

00:32:31.929 --> 00:32:35.933
"In the end, Baek Do-ha
will definitely lose to Song Ha-gyeong."

00:32:37.226 --> 00:32:38.436
You thought that, right?

00:32:45.651 --> 00:32:47.487
Sorry about that, it keeps happening.

00:33:03.836 --> 00:33:05.671
Why are you so adamant to stay by my side?

00:33:12.345 --> 00:33:14.138
Why do you want to get away from me?

00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:19.435
If you…

00:33:21.729 --> 00:33:23.439
keep hovering in front of me…

00:33:25.066 --> 00:33:26.943
I keep remembering what I'd forgotten.

00:33:28.653 --> 00:33:33.074
I've barely held on.
I've coped well without you.

00:33:34.534 --> 00:33:36.577
-But after you appeared--
-Is it hard?

00:33:38.287 --> 00:33:39.914
Because I remind you of Do-young?

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:44.252
Of the times
the three of us spent together?

00:33:48.089 --> 00:33:48.923
You too.

00:33:50.466 --> 00:33:51.801
It's hard for you too.

00:33:53.094 --> 00:33:55.138
When you see me,
you think of Baek Do-young too.

00:33:55.221 --> 00:33:56.222
No.

00:34:00.101 --> 00:34:01.310
When I see you…

00:34:02.937 --> 00:34:05.273
I remember the version of myself
that liked you.

00:34:06.691 --> 00:34:07.817
And then…

00:34:09.527 --> 00:34:12.947
I remember leaving
without confessing my feelings for you.

00:34:52.195 --> 00:34:54.071
My brother took that photo.

00:35:02.705 --> 00:35:05.374
I emailed you Baek Do-young's name…

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:08.669
but he took the photos.

00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:13.758
Among the things
the expedition members sent…

00:35:15.635 --> 00:35:16.761
there was a camera.

00:35:20.056 --> 00:35:22.058
It was full of photos of constellations,

00:35:22.141 --> 00:35:25.102
especially… the Summer Triangle.

00:35:29.148 --> 00:35:31.525
You're comfortable
talking about Do-young now.

00:35:33.653 --> 00:35:35.571
Coming back,
I decided to focus on myself.

00:35:37.156 --> 00:35:38.866
I won't keep doing things

00:35:41.535 --> 00:35:42.995
for the sake of your feelings.

00:35:44.413 --> 00:35:45.248
What?

00:35:46.749 --> 00:35:50.419
So acting like Do-young
was all because of me?

00:35:54.423 --> 00:35:56.592
Your mom was sick the whole time.

00:35:57.593 --> 00:35:59.220
You were a mess taking care of her.

00:36:00.346 --> 00:36:01.180
Do-young…

00:36:04.016 --> 00:36:04.892
was missing.

00:36:06.727 --> 00:36:09.730
I started lying
because I wanted him to still be alive.

00:36:11.232 --> 00:36:12.984
I thought it'd be better
for you and me.

00:36:14.735 --> 00:36:16.737
-That's how it started, but--
-You're saying…

00:36:19.282 --> 00:36:20.950
you fell apart because of me.

00:36:25.496 --> 00:36:26.539
I was unhappy.

00:36:28.291 --> 00:36:30.376
It was my way
of trying not to hurt anyone--

00:36:30.459 --> 00:36:31.419
So…

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.046
you lied because of me.

00:36:48.102 --> 00:36:49.270
Baek Do-ha…

00:36:50.938 --> 00:36:51.772
do you get it now?

00:36:53.566 --> 00:36:56.610
We keep driving each other
to make the wrong choices.

00:37:29.101 --> 00:37:30.311
Seul.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:35.358
I talked about Mom today
for the first time in a while,

00:37:36.359 --> 00:37:38.402
while making dugyeonju.

00:37:39.195 --> 00:37:41.280
I talked about Mom as if it was nothing.

00:37:44.492 --> 00:37:46.369
But I shouldn't do that.

00:37:48.746 --> 00:37:51.248
You know those "what ifs," Seul?

00:37:52.541 --> 00:37:55.378
What if I'd left the city hall
earlier that day…

00:37:58.255 --> 00:38:01.050
what if I hadn't ignored Mom's call
and answered right away…

00:38:04.261 --> 00:38:07.848
what if I hadn't missed the bus
and got on right away?

00:38:10.393 --> 00:38:12.019
Those "what ifs."

00:38:21.654 --> 00:38:24.156
What if
I hadn't lived in the peanut house…

00:38:28.035 --> 00:38:30.454
and I hadn't met the Baeks.

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:36.377
I think about it endlessly.

00:38:38.337 --> 00:38:40.381
I remember the version of myself
that liked you.

00:38:41.882 --> 00:38:43.050
And then…

00:38:45.302 --> 00:38:48.055
I remember leaving
without confessing my feelings for you.

00:38:49.348 --> 00:38:50.391
What about you?

00:38:51.684 --> 00:38:52.685
When you see me…

00:38:54.145 --> 00:38:56.564
don't you remember that summer
when you liked me?

00:38:59.191 --> 00:39:02.111
Isn't that why you feel sorry to Do-young?

00:39:14.874 --> 00:39:16.584
If I hadn't told Do-young

00:39:17.793 --> 00:39:20.504
that I liked Do-ha…

00:39:23.424 --> 00:39:27.344
What if I hadn't said it?

00:39:30.806 --> 00:39:32.266
What if?

00:39:39.106 --> 00:39:40.357
You're dropping the case?

00:39:41.275 --> 00:39:44.028
Yes, I'll give the house to Baek Do-ha.

00:39:49.742 --> 00:39:50.659
Are you serious?

00:39:51.911 --> 00:39:53.329
You're giving me all the rights?

00:39:55.122 --> 00:39:55.956
Yes.

00:39:57.458 --> 00:39:59.293
I'll only take my share, which is 50%.

00:40:00.461 --> 00:40:02.296
It's a wooden house that's been damaged.

00:40:02.379 --> 00:40:04.089
Does 50% of the appraisal
make sense?

00:40:04.173 --> 00:40:07.092
Then let's get it appraised.
I'll comply with that.

00:40:07.676 --> 00:40:10.554
If you charge repair costs
for the flooding, I'll pay separately.

00:40:11.347 --> 00:40:12.264
I'll be going then.

00:40:23.275 --> 00:40:24.318
Let's talk.

00:40:34.662 --> 00:40:36.247
Can you give up the peanut house?

00:40:39.375 --> 00:40:41.252
I don't want to fight with you anymore.

00:40:42.836 --> 00:40:46.006
I shouldn't have created the situation
in the first place.

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:47.508
I think I was a bit childish.

00:40:49.885 --> 00:40:52.304
Fighting with you at the peanut house
all the time…

00:40:54.723 --> 00:40:55.975
I don't want to do that.

00:40:56.892 --> 00:40:59.103
If I keep doing that with you
without thinking,

00:41:00.813 --> 00:41:02.314
I keep going back to those days.

00:41:03.315 --> 00:41:05.359
-What's wrong with that?
-I don't want to.

00:41:08.112 --> 00:41:09.905
I want to keep blaming you…

00:41:11.532 --> 00:41:13.117
and living the way I have.

00:41:15.411 --> 00:41:16.829
Without you.

00:42:04.335 --> 00:42:05.961
Here's what you asked for before.

00:42:07.338 --> 00:42:10.633
These are shops where you can get
ash tree saplings similar to Jong-man.

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:13.636
I've organized it thoroughly,

00:42:13.719 --> 00:42:16.930
so you won't need to contact me
about this again.

00:42:32.196 --> 00:42:35.574
WELCOME TO KAVER MAIL, DENEB

00:42:36.992 --> 00:42:38.452
ALTAIR (BAEK)
VEGA (SONG)

00:42:42.164 --> 00:42:44.458
You crazy bastard,
you're not Baek Do-young.

00:43:04.603 --> 00:43:08.065
SONG HA-GYEONG

00:43:19.201 --> 00:43:21.370
-Hey, Do-young.
-Hey, Song.

00:43:22.746 --> 00:43:25.332
Your mom's surgery went well, right?

00:43:26.417 --> 00:43:27.459
I'm glad.

00:43:28.085 --> 00:43:30.087
I really wanted to come this time,

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:33.674
but it just so happened
that I'm climbing Denali next week.

00:43:33.757 --> 00:43:35.884
It's the highest mountain
in North America.

00:43:37.136 --> 00:43:38.554
Am I cool?

00:44:16.884 --> 00:44:18.761
BAEK DO-HA

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:33.734
Get in.

00:44:35.277 --> 00:44:37.529
Where are we going? Just tell me.

00:44:39.823 --> 00:44:42.451
Don't you see the car behind honking?
Get in quick.

00:44:53.629 --> 00:44:54.463
Seatbelt.

00:45:29.289 --> 00:45:31.041
LEEDAEMYEONG-GA

00:45:31.124 --> 00:45:35.420
This was the hardest for me.
It wasn't my usual method.

00:45:36.755 --> 00:45:39.341
I couldn't find a technician
until completion…

00:45:40.259 --> 00:45:41.385
so I carved it myself.

00:45:43.095 --> 00:45:43.971
So,

00:45:45.389 --> 00:45:46.682
I got this as a result.

00:45:48.684 --> 00:45:52.312
By the completion date,
I got IVs five times.

00:45:52.854 --> 00:45:54.398
But I got everything done on time.

00:45:54.982 --> 00:45:56.233
Took less than six months.

00:45:56.316 --> 00:46:00.070
So what? What are you trying to say?

00:46:01.863 --> 00:46:03.490
What have you been doing for hours?

00:46:06.368 --> 00:46:07.202
Song Ha-gyeong…

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:11.206
I'm about to play my last card.

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:14.960
I didn't think I'd play it this soon.

00:46:16.545 --> 00:46:18.213
When I came to you this summer…

00:46:19.381 --> 00:46:20.632
I kept thinking,

00:46:21.717 --> 00:46:24.595
"I shouldn't use this,
Let there be no reason to use this."

00:46:25.679 --> 00:46:27.889
But I'm playing it
not in July or August…

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:31.018
but in June.

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:37.107
I guess I still have a long way to go
to beat you, Ha-gyeong.

00:46:39.234 --> 00:46:42.613
But I also brought my trump card.

00:46:44.865 --> 00:46:45.782
August 31st.

00:46:48.327 --> 00:46:49.578
That's our completion date.

00:46:51.455 --> 00:46:53.582
Until then, try living with me.

00:46:55.667 --> 00:46:59.546
Until this summer ends.
If you still can't endure it…

00:47:02.424 --> 00:47:04.134
then I'll disappear from your life.

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.181
If being with me
is still painful for you…

00:47:10.307 --> 00:47:11.725
I'll leave after the completion.

00:47:14.311 --> 00:47:16.647
So stop pushing me away
and come home.

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:19.858
If you don't join me this summer…

00:47:21.818 --> 00:47:23.195
it means nothing to me.

00:47:31.912 --> 00:47:33.413
I need time…

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:35.874
to think.

00:47:46.385 --> 00:47:47.511
Welcome.

00:48:19.334 --> 00:48:21.628
You said your summer's always unlucky
with me around.

00:48:22.254 --> 00:48:24.339
Then a bit more bad luck won't hurt.

00:48:25.465 --> 00:48:26.758
It's summer anyway.

00:48:29.594 --> 00:48:31.138
SCENT OF SUMMER

00:48:41.773 --> 00:48:44.985
SONG HA-GYEONG
LIVED 17 YEARS, 2-YEAR GAP, LEAVE PATAN

00:48:48.864 --> 00:48:51.992
BAEK DO-HA
COEL UNIV., LIVED 21 DAYS…

00:48:55.036 --> 00:48:56.997
GIVE UP PEANUT HOUSE

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:04.504
Sir,

00:49:04.588 --> 00:49:06.757
-one sake…
-One sake and one katsudon, please.

00:49:17.184 --> 00:49:20.437
Are you a stalker?
You came to my house last time, and now…

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:23.565
This isn't even Pacheon.

00:49:23.648 --> 00:49:26.902
In Seoul, a city with 10 million people,
we just ran into each other?

00:49:27.986 --> 00:49:30.197
You're not trying to pretend
it's a coincidence?

00:49:31.531 --> 00:49:32.699
Thank you.

00:49:32.783 --> 00:49:35.035
-You ordered your usual.
-Yes.

00:49:35.118 --> 00:49:36.536
You're off work early today.

00:49:44.795 --> 00:49:48.173
-One sake and four skewers.
-One sake and four skewers.

00:49:49.299 --> 00:49:53.512
Oh, no, we only have five skewers left.

00:49:54.012 --> 00:49:56.348
-Give me four then.
-Me too, four.

00:50:10.946 --> 00:50:12.322
Eating pork cutlet with rice?

00:50:13.657 --> 00:50:15.534
What? Doesn't everyone eat it like this?

00:50:16.326 --> 00:50:19.621
People who eat pork cutlet
and rice together like you

00:50:19.704 --> 00:50:21.790
do that because
they're used to eating alone.

00:50:22.332 --> 00:50:24.251
There's no one to steal your pork cutlet.

00:50:24.334 --> 00:50:26.628
Unlike me, who always eats it first.

00:50:29.172 --> 00:50:33.593
Right, four brothers and one sister.
You got pushed around a lot growing up?

00:50:34.177 --> 00:50:35.637
You only handle appeals,

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:37.639
not because you're a fixer, right?

00:50:38.515 --> 00:50:39.850
Right.

00:50:39.933 --> 00:50:43.144
As the illegitimate child, I come last.
My siblings get the first trials.

00:50:44.813 --> 00:50:48.316
As for you, you're quite short on funds.

00:50:50.944 --> 00:50:53.196
I'm tired of this back-and-forth.

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.949
Let's just toast.
Miserable people together.

00:51:01.329 --> 00:51:03.415
Why do you want to move to Seoul so badly?

00:51:04.207 --> 00:51:05.041
What's so good?

00:51:05.125 --> 00:51:07.419
Seoul's full of good things.

00:51:08.545 --> 00:51:10.213
Everyone's on their smartphones.

00:51:11.089 --> 00:51:14.467
So many people crammed together,
with zero interest

00:51:15.093 --> 00:51:16.344
in people around them.

00:51:17.137 --> 00:51:19.931
How great is that?
I love that there are no stars here.

00:51:21.141 --> 00:51:23.184
No stars? Seoul's full of stars.

00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:27.564
You've never seen Seoul's night view.

00:51:44.748 --> 00:51:49.502
Here, you see people instead of stars.
Drunk people, exhausted workers.

00:51:50.170 --> 00:51:53.340
This is the night view created by lights
that violate labor laws.

00:51:55.592 --> 00:51:57.510
The garbage truck will be here soon.

00:52:05.977 --> 00:52:06.895
What's this?

00:52:07.395 --> 00:52:10.440
This is my 99% win rate secret.

00:52:11.733 --> 00:52:15.278
I write keywords I find by researching
plaintiff and defendant on this bingo.

00:52:15.362 --> 00:52:17.197
One bingo means no chance.

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:20.533
Two bingos means a decent win.
Three bingos means a perfect win.

00:52:21.493 --> 00:52:24.621
Ordinary people
usually fit into these nine squares.

00:52:26.539 --> 00:52:28.833
What did you write
in the center of my bingo?

00:52:29.668 --> 00:52:31.711
What's your cheat code you wrote first?

00:52:32.837 --> 00:52:35.006
Why would I tell you that?
You're my opponent.

00:52:35.757 --> 00:52:36.925
I told you I'm not suing.

00:52:38.259 --> 00:52:40.845
Then want to compete?

00:52:44.391 --> 00:52:45.517
Song!

00:52:48.103 --> 00:52:49.104
What?

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.440
Where did she go?

00:52:52.524 --> 00:52:53.692
CALLING…
SONG

00:52:56.444 --> 00:52:58.405
The call cannot be connected…

00:53:11.292 --> 00:53:14.087
-Do-ha, where are you?
-At home.

00:53:15.296 --> 00:53:16.214
What are you doing?

00:53:16.297 --> 00:53:18.341
Ha-gyeong hasn't even come home.

00:53:19.217 --> 00:53:21.553
She hasn't answered her phone all day.

00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:26.683
What are you thinking?
Aren't you worried about her?

00:53:29.811 --> 00:53:31.896
Did you write that I'm illegitimate child?

00:53:32.522 --> 00:53:34.733
I wrote "out-of-wedlock child."

00:53:34.816 --> 00:53:36.860
Mind if I check
your brothers' butt-wiper too?

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:40.947
So "illegitimate child" gets a euphemism,
but "butt-wiper" doesn't? Why?

00:53:41.031 --> 00:53:42.574
It could've been "appeals expert."

00:53:42.657 --> 00:53:44.868
Whatever, moving on. My turn.

00:53:46.536 --> 00:53:48.163
Did you write
my mom died from cancer?

00:53:48.246 --> 00:53:50.707
Of course.
Her memorial day is coming up.

00:53:51.499 --> 00:53:54.753
Your father ran away to Thailand
saying he couldn't care for her?

00:53:55.587 --> 00:53:57.756
Why are you killing
two birds with one stone?

00:53:57.839 --> 00:53:59.257
Do you have three bingos?

00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:01.176
No, two bingos. The center's still empty.

00:54:02.761 --> 00:54:04.804
What did you write in the center?

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:08.558
"Baek Do-ha"? Or "peanut house"?

00:54:13.313 --> 00:54:16.149
Did you finish talking
with Mr. Baek Do-ha?

00:54:17.233 --> 00:54:20.403
It hasn't been long, but you two
seem to have enough to talk about

00:54:20.487 --> 00:54:21.654
to start a lawsuit.

00:54:24.616 --> 00:54:27.994
And there's something
I didn't mention before.

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:30.830
You asked why I took the case, right?

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:36.086
Because he said it was okay to lose.

00:54:36.628 --> 00:54:38.713
I always make sure I win every fight,

00:54:39.672 --> 00:54:41.925
so getting a request like that
was refreshing.

00:54:42.759 --> 00:54:46.012
He told me to drag it out all summer
even if we lose.

00:54:46.971 --> 00:54:48.598
That was Mr. Baek's condition.

00:54:54.979 --> 00:54:58.108
Today's bingo game
was very eye-opening and hit deep.

00:54:59.067 --> 00:55:01.569
Considering we barely know each other,
I was rather rude.

00:55:01.653 --> 00:55:06.866
Barely know? Petition, self-representation
final argument, proof of contents.

00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:10.620
I've read them dozens of times.
Plus, I heard a secret today.

00:55:13.873 --> 00:55:15.250
Wait.

00:55:15.333 --> 00:55:16.543
BAEK DO-HA

00:55:18.253 --> 00:55:21.548
It's okay not to answer?
He's been texting constantly.

00:55:22.799 --> 00:55:24.175
I don't need to see it anyway.

00:55:33.977 --> 00:55:36.980
Sorry, I should go now.

00:55:37.063 --> 00:55:38.022
Go ahead.

00:56:08.052 --> 00:56:11.514
JONG-MAN JR

00:56:53.014 --> 00:56:53.973
Song Ha-gyeong.

00:56:56.559 --> 00:56:59.520
Hey, what? What's this power outage?

00:57:01.189 --> 00:57:03.358
Did you check the breaker?

00:57:03.441 --> 00:57:05.276
Right now, the basement floor…

00:57:05.902 --> 00:57:07.528
I put varnish on it.

00:57:09.113 --> 00:57:11.032
Do you have the time to worry about this?

00:57:12.242 --> 00:57:13.493
Anything that might go bad?

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:14.994
Right.

00:57:25.088 --> 00:57:26.714
Where did it go?

00:57:28.341 --> 00:57:29.467
You scared me.

00:57:30.802 --> 00:57:33.471
Looking for the dugyeonju
your mom made?

00:57:44.357 --> 00:57:45.650
You're moving it, right?

00:57:48.861 --> 00:57:52.740
No, it says,
"24-hour service to anywhere."

00:57:52.824 --> 00:57:53.825
Patan isn't included?

00:57:54.450 --> 00:57:56.619
Then you shouldn't have
advertised falsely.

00:57:56.703 --> 00:57:58.663
Should I report this
to the consumer agency?

00:57:59.956 --> 00:58:00.790
Hey…

00:58:01.541 --> 00:58:04.335
I already tried everything
when the power went out.

00:58:04.419 --> 00:58:06.421
Give it back. Give it to me!

00:58:06.504 --> 00:58:08.131
-Seriously.
-Give it back.

00:58:08.214 --> 00:58:09.549
Seriously!

00:58:12.343 --> 00:58:14.887
-Why did you kick me?
-Why did you snatch my phone?

00:58:18.433 --> 00:58:21.185
Hey, what are you going to do?

00:58:26.441 --> 00:58:27.650
This one's safe.

00:58:43.666 --> 00:58:44.500
Hey.

00:58:45.877 --> 00:58:47.629
-Just one sip.
-No.

00:58:47.712 --> 00:58:50.214
Get one
from the Women's Association president.

00:58:50.298 --> 00:58:51.966
This is the last one my mom made.

00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:56.220
You're so cheap. Your mom
would've told you to share with me.

00:59:01.809 --> 00:59:04.437
-Just one sip.
-No.

00:59:05.438 --> 00:59:06.939
Just one sip.

00:59:07.774 --> 00:59:09.692
-No!
-Just one sip, really.

00:59:09.776 --> 00:59:11.402
-It's mine!
-Just one sip.

00:59:11.486 --> 00:59:12.320
Let go!

00:59:16.783 --> 00:59:17.784
You started it.

00:59:27.377 --> 00:59:28.211
Baek Do-ha!

00:59:32.048 --> 00:59:33.091
Cold!

00:59:43.601 --> 00:59:44.686
Wait right there.

00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:49.982
Ha-gyeong, my bad! Ha-gyeong?

00:59:52.068 --> 00:59:52.902
Ha-gyeong?

00:59:55.279 --> 00:59:56.322
Song Ha-gyeong?

01:00:00.326 --> 01:00:01.786
Hey!

01:00:06.207 --> 01:00:07.667
Seriously.

01:01:57.777 --> 01:01:58.694
It's amazing, right?

01:01:59.946 --> 01:02:04.200
That's what a home is. Even if it seems
dead, it comes back to life right away.

01:02:06.202 --> 01:02:07.119
Baek Do-ha…

01:02:08.663 --> 01:02:10.748
you're seriously such a pain.

01:02:12.041 --> 01:02:15.503
You made me drink
all of my mom's dugyeonju.

01:02:16.295 --> 01:02:18.047
I was going to take for my wedding.

01:02:19.632 --> 01:02:23.970
You made me have a water fight at night
with someone I can't even stand.

01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:27.265
And in the end…

01:02:29.183 --> 01:02:31.102
you made me give this answer.

01:02:38.442 --> 01:02:39.360
Fine.

01:02:40.319 --> 01:02:41.279
Let's give it a try.

01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:43.698
For real?

01:02:43.781 --> 01:02:46.826
But don't go
even one day past the completion date.

01:02:52.123 --> 01:02:53.457
I was really scared this time.

01:02:57.753 --> 01:03:00.339
Hey, summer's a throwaway season
for me anyway.

01:03:01.382 --> 01:03:04.594
I never had luck to begin with.
Sticking with you won't change that.

01:03:05.928 --> 01:03:09.640
Spending a season with you
won't change a thing between us.

01:03:11.642 --> 01:03:13.102
Summer's long.

01:03:14.312 --> 01:03:17.064
The one who stayed for just 21 days
now has 80 days.

01:03:22.361 --> 01:03:24.113
I'll do whatever I can.

01:03:30.077 --> 01:03:32.705
So I'm really going to…

01:03:33.789 --> 01:03:34.999
change your mind.

01:03:41.088 --> 01:03:43.799
Our last summer has begun.

01:04:24.590 --> 01:04:26.342
-What's this?
-A house-sharing agreement.

01:04:27.051 --> 01:04:29.553
Our summers always had lots of surprises.

01:04:29.637 --> 01:04:30.554
Can't sleep?

01:04:31.472 --> 01:04:34.183
Actually, why did you barge in?

01:04:34.266 --> 01:04:37.603
I'm just trying to live
with the immature Song Ha-gyeong.

01:04:40.106 --> 01:04:42.900
Come to think of it,
you two are equally immature.

01:04:42.984 --> 01:04:44.652
It's because of you.

01:04:44.735 --> 01:04:47.029
It's because of you,
so don't ask me anymore. Got it?

01:04:47.655 --> 01:04:48.864
Yes, I'm coming.

01:04:48.948 --> 01:04:50.992
Ms. Song, do you like Baek Do-ha?

01:04:51.784 --> 01:04:52.660
I do.

01:04:53.619 --> 01:04:56.330
I know Baek Do-ha's blueprints
better than he does.

01:04:57.039 --> 01:04:59.458
What did I get caught for?
Don't get the wrong idea.

01:05:00.084 --> 01:05:03.713
Yeah, actually I…
