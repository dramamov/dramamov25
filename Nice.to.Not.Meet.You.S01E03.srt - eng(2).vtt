00:01:06.338 --> 00:01:07.756
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin?

00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.051
-Yes?
-May I have

00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:12.970
a moment of your time?

00:01:13.637 --> 00:01:14.555
Right now?

00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:19.685
But I'm on my way to work.

00:01:20.477 --> 00:01:21.979
I just need a moment.

00:01:25.107 --> 00:01:26.191
You said
your brother's a detective, right?

00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:28.736
What? Oh, that's right.

00:01:29.653 --> 00:01:30.946
Does he have a girlfriend?

00:01:31.447 --> 00:01:32.531
I don't think so.

00:01:33.157 --> 00:01:35.159
So what's his type?

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:36.952
I'm not sure,

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.163
but maybe someone intellectual?

00:01:39.246 --> 00:01:41.373
I see. The intellectual type.

00:01:41.457 --> 00:01:44.209
-My sister went to Hankuk University.
-Really?

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.045
She must've been a top student.

00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:49.924
But why ask about my brother?

00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:53.469
Well, my sister is
surprisingly decent-looking,

00:01:53.552 --> 00:01:54.762
but she hasn't dated anyone.

00:01:54.845 --> 00:01:57.306
I can see that. My brother's the same.

00:01:57.389 --> 00:02:00.392
If I let him be,
he might end up marrying an AI assistant.

00:02:03.687 --> 00:02:06.607
I'm sorry for showing up unannounced.

00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:08.609
-Sorry?
-You must be startled.

00:02:08.692 --> 00:02:09.693
Well, I…

00:02:10.778 --> 00:02:12.154
It's all right.

00:02:12.237 --> 00:02:13.697
What brings you here all of a sudden?

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:17.117
I came to apologize.

00:02:18.285 --> 00:02:19.578
Apologize to me?

00:02:20.496 --> 00:02:21.580
Yes.

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:25.167
For getting you
kicked out of the interview.

00:02:26.043 --> 00:02:27.294
I want to apologize for that.

00:02:28.295 --> 00:02:30.297
Looking back at it now,

00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:34.009
what I did was incredibly rude
and should've never happened.

00:02:34.093 --> 00:02:37.137
I'm truly sorry.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.264
Right.

00:02:44.144 --> 00:02:45.479
With that in mind…

00:02:48.357 --> 00:02:51.151
My lawyer and I

00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:54.154
prepared an agreement.

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:56.699
"Agreement."

00:02:56.782 --> 00:02:59.451
"Wi Jeong-sin
shall not publish any information

00:02:59.535 --> 00:03:03.330
about Lim Hyeon-jun without
first confirming it with his agency."

00:03:03.414 --> 00:03:07.042
"Should she publish an article
harming the actor's reputation,

00:03:07.126 --> 00:03:09.169
she must pay the agreed compensation."

00:03:09.253 --> 00:03:11.880
"If this agreement is honored
for the next five years,

00:03:11.964 --> 00:03:14.633
she will be granted
at least two exclusive interviews per year

00:03:14.717 --> 00:03:16.510
and will receive exclusive coverage rights

00:03:16.593 --> 00:03:19.430
for any dramas, films, or projects
in which the actor is cast."

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.559
My lawyer and I put our heads together

00:03:23.642 --> 00:03:28.105
to figure out how you and I
could have a constructive relationship.

00:03:28.188 --> 00:03:29.898
A win-win situation, that is.

00:03:29.982 --> 00:03:32.901
It'll benefit me
as my private life won't be publicized,

00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:35.112
and it'll benefit you
as you'll be able to publish exclusives

00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:36.613
and get acknowledged at work.

00:03:37.197 --> 00:03:38.866
Something like that.

00:03:40.117 --> 00:03:42.578
My lawyer and I even got it notarized.

00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:43.871
Hey!

00:03:45.414 --> 00:03:47.249
AGREEMENT

00:03:47.332 --> 00:03:50.127
If you ever show up like this
one more time,

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.048
every article I've written
will look tame compared to what's next.

00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:59.386
I can destroy you
with nothing more than my writing.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.514
I can teach you what it feels like
for your blood to run cold

00:04:02.598 --> 00:04:04.183
and your throat to clamp shut.

00:04:04.725 --> 00:04:05.726
Keep going…

00:04:07.352 --> 00:04:08.729
if you want to find out.

00:04:22.034 --> 00:04:24.328
You want to set up your sister
with my brother?

00:04:26.747 --> 00:04:28.082
EPISODE 3

00:04:35.506 --> 00:04:38.217
If you ever show up like this
one more time,

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.179
every article I've written
will look tame compared to what's next.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.142
You're back in the game, Wi Jeong-sin.

00:04:47.851 --> 00:04:48.811
My head's on straight.

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:57.486
I think I messed with
the wrong crazy lady.

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.863
So why did you have to stir things up?

00:04:59.947 --> 00:05:01.907
Don't you know how proud reporters are?

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.201
Exactly. Since she has no money or fame,

00:05:04.284 --> 00:05:07.287
she's living off nothing but pride,
so of course, it's important.

00:05:07.371 --> 00:05:10.958
And you stomped all over
that important pride, bro!

00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:12.126
No, that's not it.

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:15.546
Imagine how much her pride must hurt
working at a hostess bar.

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:16.713
As a reporter, I mean.

00:05:16.797 --> 00:05:21.635
That's not something you do as a hobby,
so she's obviously doing it for the money.

00:05:21.718 --> 00:05:23.512
If she gets exclusive coverage rights,

00:05:23.595 --> 00:05:25.389
she can earn both money
and recognition at work.

00:05:25.472 --> 00:05:27.307
She'd be killing two birds with one stone.

00:05:27.391 --> 00:05:28.976
Are you sure she works at a hostess bar?

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:31.353
She doesn't look like the type at all!

00:05:31.436 --> 00:05:33.814
Looks can be deceiving.

00:05:34.314 --> 00:05:37.151
You're a manager for an actor,
so you should know this by now.

00:05:37.234 --> 00:05:40.070
Well, they do say
never to trust those in the show biz.

00:05:40.154 --> 00:05:41.405
What did you say?

00:05:41.488 --> 00:05:43.157
-Hey, head to the office.
-Yes, sir.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.616
I have something important to tell you.

00:05:45.117 --> 00:05:47.703
What is it? Did we get a project offer?

00:05:58.297 --> 00:05:59.214
Wait.

00:05:59.923 --> 00:06:01.967
You should clean that up before you go.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.218
The cleaning staff will do it.

00:06:03.302 --> 00:06:06.263
If we can dump trash anywhere
because we have the cleaning staff,

00:06:06.346 --> 00:06:08.182
then why are there fines for littering?

00:06:08.265 --> 00:06:10.767
If you're unsure about public etiquette,
how about I teach you?

00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:13.687
If you're here to guard someone,
do that instead of getting physical!

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.314
You're only disgracing
the artist you're bodyguarding!

00:06:17.733 --> 00:06:19.359
-What did you just say?
-Hey, forget it.

00:06:19.443 --> 00:06:22.696
If you don't have public etiquette,
what about a conscience?

00:06:29.161 --> 00:06:31.496
Seriously, the trash can's right there.

00:06:37.878 --> 00:06:40.380
A small-town widowed detective?

00:06:40.464 --> 00:06:42.466
How is this any different
from Kang Pil-gu?

00:06:42.549 --> 00:06:45.552
How is this going to
change my public image?

00:06:45.636 --> 00:06:47.804
Why do you insist
on changing your public image?

00:06:47.888 --> 00:06:50.182
Don't you know how lucky you are
to be called by your character's name?

00:06:50.265 --> 00:06:52.226
It's actually a blessing, bro.

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:54.978
Don't you know how much
an actor's public image matters?

00:06:55.062 --> 00:06:55.979
My mom…

00:07:01.944 --> 00:07:03.403
You know what I'm talking about.

00:07:03.487 --> 00:07:05.155
Come on, bro.

00:07:05.239 --> 00:07:07.658
It was a totally different time back then.

00:07:07.741 --> 00:07:08.784
Listen.

00:07:08.867 --> 00:07:10.494
My mom still can't escape
that erotic film actress image,

00:07:10.577 --> 00:07:13.413
even though 40 years have passed!

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:15.582
Mr. Hwang.

00:07:16.124 --> 00:07:18.752
I want to have a long-lasting career.

00:07:18.835 --> 00:07:21.004
That's why I'm behaving this way.

00:07:25.175 --> 00:07:26.510
What about the plays?

00:07:27.594 --> 00:07:28.428
The plays?

00:07:28.512 --> 00:07:29.888
Yeah.

00:07:29.972 --> 00:07:32.849
Right, so the thing is…

00:07:32.933 --> 00:07:34.184
Lim Hyeon-jun?

00:07:34.268 --> 00:07:35.560
We'd love to have him!

00:07:35.644 --> 00:07:38.522
Our theater group
is starting a new project.

00:07:38.605 --> 00:07:40.023
It's called The Old Detective.

00:07:40.107 --> 00:07:41.858
Our play has just opened,

00:07:41.942 --> 00:07:45.070
so the next one won't begin
until next fall.

00:07:45.153 --> 00:07:46.863
Our play is about a university judo team,

00:07:46.947 --> 00:07:48.073
so he's not the right age.

00:07:49.074 --> 00:07:51.451
Perhaps we could
disguise him with makeup, sir?

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.289
I wonder why no one's reaching out.

00:08:02.212 --> 00:08:03.130
What's that?

00:08:08.844 --> 00:08:10.804
-What's this?
-Just read it.

00:08:11.471 --> 00:08:12.597
A PLACE TO STAY

00:08:14.641 --> 00:08:15.851
Someone did reach out, after all.

00:08:16.435 --> 00:08:18.812
But what's with the face?

00:08:20.188 --> 00:08:21.565
Is the script that terrible?

00:08:28.363 --> 00:08:29.531
Seon-u, when will you tell your family

00:08:29.614 --> 00:08:31.283
that you're taking a break
from med school?

00:08:31.366 --> 00:08:32.784
I'll tell them sometime.

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:35.954
Didn't your brother work really hard
to support you?

00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:40.417
By the way, do you really want to
set up your sister with my brother?

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.335
Yeah.

00:08:41.418 --> 00:08:43.086
If it works out, great. If not, oh well.

00:08:44.838 --> 00:08:45.881
Do you have a photo of her?

00:08:47.215 --> 00:08:48.508
A photo of my sister?

00:08:49.718 --> 00:08:52.596
There should be one right here.
This is what she looks like.

00:08:53.764 --> 00:08:56.183
Man, she's beautiful!
And she looks so intellectual.

00:08:56.266 --> 00:08:57.100
What?

00:08:59.102 --> 00:09:01.146
Well, what about your brother?

00:09:01.229 --> 00:09:02.522
-Do you have a photo?
-My brother?

00:09:06.693 --> 00:09:07.694
He looks like that.

00:09:08.362 --> 00:09:09.821
-They look very similar.
-Really?

00:09:09.905 --> 00:09:12.616
I'd totally welcome
a brother-in-law like Pil-gu.

00:09:12.699 --> 00:09:14.868
Kang Pil-gu's pick! Kang Pil-gu mode, on!

00:09:15.452 --> 00:09:17.079
KANG PIL-GU'S PICK!

00:09:25.379 --> 00:09:27.339
A PLACE TO STAY

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.678
Man, this is good.

00:09:33.762 --> 00:09:35.138
HWANG JI-SUN

00:09:36.181 --> 00:09:37.182
Hey, Mr. Hwang!

00:09:37.933 --> 00:09:39.393
Tell them I want to do this.

00:09:39.476 --> 00:09:42.479
-Oh, you like it?
-I love it.

00:09:42.562 --> 00:09:44.856
I don't want anyone
stealing this role from me.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.608
So call them right now, and say I'm in.

00:09:46.691 --> 00:09:48.151
Do you like it that much?

00:09:48.235 --> 00:09:50.695
Since he's a doctor
who recovers after being ill,

00:09:51.321 --> 00:09:52.864
I should probably lose some weight, right?

00:09:53.448 --> 00:09:54.991
That's it. I'm going on a diet.

00:09:55.742 --> 00:09:58.203
Darn it, I've gained some weight
around my waist recently.

00:09:58.286 --> 00:10:00.831
Do I need help slimming it down?

00:10:00.914 --> 00:10:03.125
Anyway, I want this role.
Call them right away, got it?

00:10:03.708 --> 00:10:06.670
In that case, you should come right now.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.046
Right now?

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.674
Su-ji, play some upbeat music.

00:10:10.757 --> 00:10:11.591
Sure.

00:10:25.439 --> 00:10:26.565
Hyeon-jun.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.400
You look like you're in a good mood.

00:10:30.569 --> 00:10:32.946
Yeah, I guess I am.

00:10:33.655 --> 00:10:35.907
You've been coming by often.

00:10:35.991 --> 00:10:38.034
-Don't you have to study?
-Well, the exams are over.

00:10:38.743 --> 00:10:39.703
Hey, how does a blind date sound?

00:10:43.748 --> 00:10:44.875
A blind date?

00:10:47.085 --> 00:10:48.003
With who?

00:10:48.086 --> 00:10:48.962
My friend's sister.

00:10:49.045 --> 00:10:51.298
I saw a photo of her,
and she's totally your type.

00:10:51.381 --> 00:10:52.215
Well…

00:10:53.133 --> 00:10:54.801
What does she do?

00:10:54.885 --> 00:10:56.303
She went to Hankuk University
and works as a reporter.

00:10:57.554 --> 00:10:58.680
You…

00:10:58.763 --> 00:11:01.391
Reporters infuriate me so much,
they keep me up at night!

00:11:01.475 --> 00:11:03.935
Besides, who goes on blind dates
at my age?

00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:05.061
People should meet naturally.

00:11:05.145 --> 00:11:06.771
Organic dating is tough for you now!

00:11:08.064 --> 00:11:10.567
Hey, this is Lim Hyeon-jun
you're talking to.

00:11:11.067 --> 00:11:11.902
Got it?

00:11:29.544 --> 00:11:31.004
Hello? Have you arrived?

00:11:31.713 --> 00:11:33.048
I'll be right out.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.883
All right.

00:11:39.804 --> 00:11:41.139
RESERVED

00:11:47.312 --> 00:11:48.146
That's enough.

00:12:11.586 --> 00:12:13.880
-Why did you sigh?
-I didn't sigh.

00:12:13.964 --> 00:12:15.173
Why? What's going on?

00:12:15.257 --> 00:12:16.466
Nothing's going on.

00:12:38.029 --> 00:12:38.863
Why am I here?

00:12:38.947 --> 00:12:40.699
That script you really liked…

00:12:41.283 --> 00:12:42.534
She's the female lead.

00:12:44.703 --> 00:12:47.956
Mr. Hwang, can you give us a moment?

00:12:50.542 --> 00:12:51.710
Take a seat.

00:13:03.513 --> 00:13:05.265
I heard you really liked the script.

00:13:05.348 --> 00:13:06.516
Let's do it.

00:13:10.353 --> 00:13:12.564
If one of us has to drop out,

00:13:12.647 --> 00:13:14.399
who do you think that should be?

00:13:14.482 --> 00:13:17.277
-Between you and me, that is.
-No, don't.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.278
Don't talk like that.

00:13:19.237 --> 00:13:20.655
Don't you want to be in this movie?

00:13:20.739 --> 00:13:23.450
Aren't you sick of just being Kang Pil-gu?

00:13:25.702 --> 00:13:27.162
Have you lost your memory?

00:13:29.205 --> 00:13:32.042
Don't you remember why
I left the industry in the first place?

00:13:33.043 --> 00:13:34.461
Do you seriously not know…

00:13:36.546 --> 00:13:37.589
what you did to me?

00:13:40.216 --> 00:13:41.384
You need to drop out.

00:13:42.302 --> 00:13:44.679
We can't possibly work together
on the same project.

00:13:45.263 --> 00:13:46.431
Se-na.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.559
You're the lead character,
and I'm a supporting character.

00:13:49.643 --> 00:13:53.355
-No one will care about us.
-But I will.

00:13:53.438 --> 00:13:55.023
It bothers me.

00:13:55.815 --> 00:13:57.567
I really need this role.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:05.075
Is this how you're going to be?

00:14:05.659 --> 00:14:09.079
Will I have to drop out
every time we end up on the same project?

00:14:11.956 --> 00:14:14.292
Do you want me to disappear entirely
from this industry?

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:18.254
Yes.

00:14:19.297 --> 00:14:20.590
It'd be great if you disappeared.

00:14:23.677 --> 00:14:24.886
Close the door, will you?

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:36.690
Fine.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.358
I'll do it.

00:14:40.819 --> 00:14:41.653
Yes.

00:14:41.736 --> 00:14:43.154
-You'll do it?
-Yeah.

00:14:43.738 --> 00:14:44.948
What's there to stop me?

00:14:45.031 --> 00:14:46.783
But let's go over a few things first.

00:14:46.866 --> 00:14:48.201
How much are they offering?

00:14:49.452 --> 00:14:51.037
How much are they paying you, Se-na?

00:14:51.121 --> 00:14:52.622
One billion won? Two billion?

00:14:54.499 --> 00:14:55.625
Whatever the case,

00:14:56.543 --> 00:14:59.462
I want double what she's getting.

00:14:59.546 --> 00:15:00.839
That's okay, right?

00:15:00.922 --> 00:15:03.800
-Come on, bro.
-Why not?

00:15:03.883 --> 00:15:07.178
I feel like shit,
so I might as well get paid well for it.

00:15:07.262 --> 00:15:10.724
I'll have to stand in front of her,
laughing and crying,

00:15:10.807 --> 00:15:12.767
and putting on the performance of my life.

00:15:12.851 --> 00:15:15.520
So I deserve to get paid
at least that much, don't you think?

00:15:15.603 --> 00:15:17.772
-Right, Mr. Hwang?
-Yes.

00:15:31.578 --> 00:15:32.746
We've arrived.

00:15:32.829 --> 00:15:35.915
Good work today, Gil-su.
You can get going.

00:15:35.999 --> 00:15:37.751
Okay. I'll be off, then.

00:15:45.467 --> 00:15:47.093
-Mr. Hwang.
-Yeah?

00:15:47.844 --> 00:15:50.430
I don't want to be manipulated
by Gwon Se-na again.

00:15:50.513 --> 00:15:51.598
Of course not.

00:15:51.681 --> 00:15:53.433
If you don't want to do it, then don't.

00:15:53.516 --> 00:15:54.726
You can just be Kang Pil-gu…

00:15:58.354 --> 00:16:00.690
There's something
I've been thinking about for a while.

00:16:01.191 --> 00:16:03.693
They say to turn a crisis
into an opportunity.

00:16:04.652 --> 00:16:07.113
-I think I'm ready to give it a shot.
-Give what a shot?

00:16:08.072 --> 00:16:10.283
-I want to take my career overseas.
-Overseas?

00:16:10.366 --> 00:16:11.993
Where? Hollywood?

00:16:12.994 --> 00:16:15.038
I'll send out demo videos,
go to auditions,

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.457
set up meetings, and do whatever I can.

00:16:19.542 --> 00:16:20.502
So prepare yourself.

00:16:38.895 --> 00:16:40.647
Goodness. Hello, Son.

00:16:41.147 --> 00:16:41.981
Did you just get back?

00:16:42.565 --> 00:16:43.775
What's all this?

00:16:45.443 --> 00:16:46.277
They sell the same in Korea

00:16:46.361 --> 00:16:49.280
but for so much cheaper,
so I couldn't help but buy them.

00:16:51.115 --> 00:16:52.492
Right, of course.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:56.204
Doctor.

00:16:56.287 --> 00:16:59.666
Mi-ran used to play my character's maid
back in the day.

00:17:00.875 --> 00:17:04.629
You know, when the main character
was hopelessly in love with me,

00:17:04.712 --> 00:17:08.216
she'd swoop in and seduce him
while I wasn't looking.

00:17:09.843 --> 00:17:12.095
Who knew her career
would take off like that?

00:17:12.178 --> 00:17:14.180
Can you stop talking about that?

00:17:14.264 --> 00:17:17.267
Shooting erotic films
isn't something to be proud of.

00:17:19.435 --> 00:17:21.020
I only filmed three!

00:17:21.104 --> 00:17:23.648
She became TV's favorite mom
after playing my maid

00:17:23.731 --> 00:17:25.859
and went on to win awards
at the Cannes Film Festival.

00:17:25.942 --> 00:17:28.528
Everyone started out that way back then.

00:17:28.611 --> 00:17:30.238
If only I'd continued acting--

00:17:30.321 --> 00:17:32.073
Jeez, cut.

00:17:32.156 --> 00:17:34.367
Anyway, why are you here?
Why didn't you go home?

00:17:36.953 --> 00:17:38.955
I wanted to talk to you about something.

00:17:40.707 --> 00:17:41.875
Listen, Jun.

00:17:42.709 --> 00:17:45.378
Can you buy me another car?

00:17:45.461 --> 00:17:47.213
-Another one?
-Yes.

00:17:48.006 --> 00:17:49.424
You want me to buy you another car?

00:17:50.758 --> 00:17:52.510
The thing is…

00:17:53.177 --> 00:17:55.054
I let someone borrow

00:17:55.138 --> 00:17:57.390
the car that I had.

00:18:06.691 --> 00:18:09.152
The patient's oxygen levels are dropping!
Secure the airway and…

00:18:11.988 --> 00:18:13.531
Excuse me.

00:18:13.615 --> 00:18:15.617
When can I see a doctor?
Will I have to wait long?

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.160
It'll just be a moment.

00:18:31.799 --> 00:18:33.343
Are you out of your mind?

00:18:33.426 --> 00:18:36.971
He's a con man
trying to live off your public image!

00:18:37.055 --> 00:18:39.140
Director Jang isn't like that!

00:18:39.223 --> 00:18:43.019
-He's an artist!
-An artist? Are you kidding me?

00:18:43.102 --> 00:18:46.564
Then tell me, does this movie
not have any nude scenes in it?

00:18:46.648 --> 00:18:49.233
I could do it just this once
for the sake of the movie…

00:18:49.317 --> 00:18:51.027
-Come on, Mom!
-What?

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:52.654
You can't take off your clothes!

00:18:52.737 --> 00:18:56.324
Oh, why not? I want to do this movie.

00:18:56.991 --> 00:18:59.452
I read Director Jang's movie script,

00:18:59.535 --> 00:19:01.037
-and it's a work of art.
-Art, my ass.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.956
It could go to Cannes.

00:19:03.039 --> 00:19:04.374
Cannes isn't some kind of joke!

00:19:04.457 --> 00:19:07.919
The only thing he filmed
was a third-rate movie 20 years ago!

00:19:08.002 --> 00:19:09.545
He's basically jobless right now!

00:19:09.629 --> 00:19:11.756
-Get it together, please!
-Hey!

00:19:12.674 --> 00:19:14.842
Why can't you be more understanding?

00:19:15.426 --> 00:19:18.513
I got the best script offers
when I was in my prime,

00:19:18.596 --> 00:19:20.640
but I gave it all up after I had you.

00:19:21.391 --> 00:19:23.518
I know I shouldn't say this as a mother,

00:19:24.185 --> 00:19:26.020
but if I hadn't
given birth to you back then,

00:19:26.104 --> 00:19:30.316
I could've escaped my sexy public image,
and my career would've taken off!

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:32.944
Well,

00:19:33.027 --> 00:19:36.447
at least you're aware
it's not something a mother should say.

00:19:36.531 --> 00:19:37.740
I know you're my son,

00:19:38.533 --> 00:19:40.952
but I can't help but envy you.

00:20:10.815 --> 00:20:12.233
I know you're my son,

00:20:13.818 --> 00:20:16.112
but I can't help but envy you.

00:20:19.824 --> 00:20:21.284
You must be Ms. Seong Ae-suk's son.

00:20:21.367 --> 00:20:22.744
Do you know my mom?

00:20:22.827 --> 00:20:23.745
Of course.

00:20:23.828 --> 00:20:25.955
Your mom is a very famous actress.

00:20:26.039 --> 00:20:27.498
You look just like her.

00:20:28.291 --> 00:20:29.792
THE GODMOTHER

00:20:30.835 --> 00:20:33.755
Move aside! Where's Seong Ae-suk?

00:20:35.381 --> 00:20:37.717
I don't even know
who the hell your husband is!

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.303
Why? Is it because
you can't keep track of all your men?

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.975
Hyeon-jun is a good boy
and he's very smart.

00:20:46.059 --> 00:20:47.518
Goodness.

00:20:47.602 --> 00:20:51.105
Hyeon-jun, you're so lucky
to have such a beautiful mom.

00:21:00.782 --> 00:21:02.742
If I hadn't given birth to you back then,

00:21:02.825 --> 00:21:06.537
I could've escaped my sexy public image,
and my career would've taken off!

00:21:46.452 --> 00:21:47.286
PUBLISH REQUEST SENT!

00:21:53.835 --> 00:21:55.711
I just published
the article on Han Chi-su.

00:21:55.795 --> 00:21:56.629
Where are you?

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.215
I'm at the emergency room.

00:21:59.298 --> 00:22:00.925
The emergency room? Why?

00:22:01.008 --> 00:22:01.884
My stomach hurts badly.

00:22:02.468 --> 00:22:04.929
Did you just write an article in the ER?

00:22:05.012 --> 00:22:06.013
Yes.

00:22:07.557 --> 00:22:08.391
All right.

00:22:08.891 --> 00:22:10.518
Get checked and call me later.

00:22:10.601 --> 00:22:11.561
All right.

00:22:30.705 --> 00:22:31.539
Hyeon-jun!

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.834
-The person you are trying to reach…
-Bro!

00:22:34.917 --> 00:22:35.751
Bro?

00:22:38.296 --> 00:22:39.130
Bro.

00:22:41.132 --> 00:22:42.133
Bro!

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:43.968
Where the hell is he?

00:22:47.138 --> 00:22:47.972
Hyeon-jun!

00:22:50.641 --> 00:22:51.517
Hyeon-jun!

00:22:52.101 --> 00:22:54.312
119 EMERGENCY SERVICES

00:22:59.942 --> 00:23:02.320
Jeong-sin, are you okay? Are you awake?

00:23:03.613 --> 00:23:04.447
What happened?

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:07.950
Your appendix burst,
so you had to have surgery.

00:23:08.034 --> 00:23:09.118
My appendix?

00:23:11.204 --> 00:23:13.873
Why'd you put up with the pain
until you passed out?

00:23:14.665 --> 00:23:15.499
Be quiet.

00:23:15.583 --> 00:23:16.709
Hankuk University grad, my ass.

00:23:16.792 --> 00:23:18.669
You can't even speak up
when you're in pain.

00:23:18.753 --> 00:23:21.005
-Why do you act so dumb?
-Cut it out.

00:23:21.088 --> 00:23:22.381
It's not like I'm dying.

00:23:23.925 --> 00:23:24.842
It's just…

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.304
You're the only family I have left.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.140
What's wrong with you?

00:23:31.807 --> 00:23:33.309
I was so scared.

00:23:34.435 --> 00:23:36.270
This is so annoying, damn it.

00:23:40.733 --> 00:23:41.609
SPORTS EUNSEONG

00:23:41.692 --> 00:23:45.446
I met Lee Mi-ra yesterday.
She's in the new SBC variety show In Sync.

00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:47.240
But there's not much to write about.

00:23:47.323 --> 00:23:49.742
She just said she gained 5 kg
while on a break.

00:23:49.825 --> 00:23:51.244
Then make that the main headline.

00:23:51.327 --> 00:23:54.622
"Lee Mi-ra Struggles with Weight Gain."
Something like that.

00:23:55.373 --> 00:23:57.875
-Yes, ma'am.
-Chief, with Ms. Wi gone,

00:23:57.959 --> 00:24:01.420
Mr. Ha has been covering for her,
but it's getting to be a bit much.

00:24:01.504 --> 00:24:04.423
I think we need a plan
in case Ms. Wi is gone for a while.

00:24:07.969 --> 00:24:08.844
This is Yun Hwa-yeong.

00:24:10.304 --> 00:24:11.430
Early this morning?

00:24:12.014 --> 00:24:13.015
Which hospital?

00:24:14.308 --> 00:24:15.268
Understood.

00:24:17.186 --> 00:24:20.106
Lim Hyeon-jun was taken to the ER
after a suicide attempt.

00:24:20.189 --> 00:24:21.232
Lim Hyeon-jun?

00:24:21.315 --> 00:24:24.068
He took a bunch of sleeping pills,
but word hasn't spread yet.

00:24:24.151 --> 00:24:25.736
Write up an exclusive right now.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.322
He's at Gusan University Hospital.
Ha Seong-min, go there now.

00:24:28.406 --> 00:24:31.617
Gusan University Hospital?
That's where Ms. Wi was admitted.

00:24:33.244 --> 00:24:35.955
I'm telling you that's not what happened!

00:24:36.038 --> 00:24:37.999
I had a drink but still couldn't sleep,

00:24:38.082 --> 00:24:40.626
so I took a few sleeping pills
from a previous prescription.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:41.877
That's it!

00:24:41.961 --> 00:24:46.590
Why did you take "a few" sleeping pills
instead of the prescribed dosage?

00:24:46.674 --> 00:24:49.510
One didn't work,
so I took a few, all right?

00:24:49.593 --> 00:24:53.055
I'm in this mess right now
because you panicked and reported me!

00:24:53.139 --> 00:24:55.474
Bro, do you swear
you're telling the truth?

00:24:55.558 --> 00:24:56.684
Do you think I'm crazy?

00:24:56.767 --> 00:24:58.019
You think I took meds to kill myself?

00:24:59.478 --> 00:25:02.315
-For goodness' sake.
-Then you should've been more careful!

00:25:02.398 --> 00:25:03.232
This is a crucial moment for you.

00:25:03.316 --> 00:25:04.817
Just say I collapsed from exhaustion.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.736
You're good at spinning the media.

00:25:06.819 --> 00:25:07.695
Forget it.

00:25:07.778 --> 00:25:09.989
Use this opportunity
to get a proper hospital check-up.

00:25:10.072 --> 00:25:12.199
When you kept taking
those herbal calming pills,

00:25:12.283 --> 00:25:13.868
it made me feel really uneasy.

00:25:13.951 --> 00:25:15.619
What hospital?

00:25:15.703 --> 00:25:16.579
A psychiatric hospital?

00:25:16.662 --> 00:25:18.456
Yeah. I know a good one.

00:25:18.539 --> 00:25:20.124
You're overreacting.

00:25:20.708 --> 00:25:22.209
I just want to go home.

00:25:24.879 --> 00:25:26.630
Wait, hold on.

00:25:27.381 --> 00:25:28.215
I need to stay longer.

00:25:28.299 --> 00:25:30.301
-You sure you're okay?
-I'm fine.

00:25:30.384 --> 00:25:31.635
I'm perfectly fine.

00:25:31.719 --> 00:25:32.678
-I'm staying longer.
-Bro.

00:25:32.762 --> 00:25:35.264
-Bro, are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm fine. I'm staying.

00:25:35.848 --> 00:25:37.308
Hey, get in touch with Byeong-gi.

00:25:38.017 --> 00:25:39.310
Nurse!

00:25:39.393 --> 00:25:40.353
Hey, eat quietly.

00:25:41.479 --> 00:25:44.273
-Are you rubbing it in?
-Quit moving around,

00:25:44.357 --> 00:25:45.441
or your stitches will pop.

00:25:45.524 --> 00:25:47.985
At least I'm not looking at you as I eat.

00:25:48.069 --> 00:25:49.195
So just be patient.

00:25:49.278 --> 00:25:51.405
Once you pass some gas,

00:25:51.489 --> 00:25:53.657
your sweet brother
will cook whatever you like.

00:25:53.741 --> 00:25:55.659
But before that, I have a favor to ask.

00:25:55.743 --> 00:25:57.912
Well, save it
because I won't do any favors for you.

00:25:57.995 --> 00:25:59.121
Would you be interested in a blind date?

00:26:00.581 --> 00:26:03.000
Why would I trust anyone
you introduce me to?

00:26:04.251 --> 00:26:06.462
I have a friend who goes to med school.

00:26:06.545 --> 00:26:10.466
-It's his brother. He's a detective.
-Detectives hate reporters.

00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:12.134
He'll refuse to see me first.

00:26:12.218 --> 00:26:13.969
Just leave that to me.

00:26:14.053 --> 00:26:17.098
Having a detective as a boyfriend
could be helpful in your line of work.

00:26:17.181 --> 00:26:18.808
On top of that, I hear he's handsome.

00:26:19.308 --> 00:26:21.143
He looks like that.
They look very similar.

00:26:21.727 --> 00:26:23.646
He looks like my bro Pil-gu.
Lim Hyeon-jun, that is.

00:26:25.439 --> 00:26:27.149
-Kang Pil-gu?
-Yeah.

00:26:33.906 --> 00:26:35.408
Don't regret it later.

00:26:35.491 --> 00:26:37.451
Let's get you out of your SSB status
before you get older.

00:26:42.039 --> 00:26:42.957
Wi Jeong-sin, I see you're still alive.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.669
Lim Hyeon-jun attempted suicide?

00:26:46.752 --> 00:26:49.130
Shouldn't you be up to date
with entertainment news?

00:26:49.213 --> 00:26:52.716
Lim Hyeon-jun was brought to this ER
after overdosing on sleeping pills.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.135
That's why I need you.

00:26:54.718 --> 00:26:56.762
You want to return
to the main paper, don't you?

00:26:56.846 --> 00:26:59.765
You'll need to demonstrate clear results
to justify your return.

00:27:00.933 --> 00:27:03.227
What kind of results can I show
from something like this?

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:06.981
Lim Hyeon-jun's agency will claim
he just collapsed from exhaustion.

00:27:07.064 --> 00:27:08.899
And the truth will get buried.

00:27:08.983 --> 00:27:11.652
But I want special coverage of this story.

00:27:12.445 --> 00:27:13.404
While you're here,

00:27:13.487 --> 00:27:15.531
find out everything you can
about his suicide attempt

00:27:15.614 --> 00:27:17.908
and get some photos of him
during his stay.

00:27:17.992 --> 00:27:22.204
If you come up with ten useful scoops
including this article,

00:27:22.288 --> 00:27:24.623
I'll get you back to the main paper
within three months.

00:27:25.541 --> 00:27:26.876
What do you say?

00:27:30.504 --> 00:27:31.630
What is it?

00:27:31.714 --> 00:27:33.549
You want to return to the main paper,

00:27:33.632 --> 00:27:36.260
but you're annoyed
you have to chase after a celebrity again?

00:27:36.343 --> 00:27:37.178
I…

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:39.763
-It's not that.
-Wi Jeong-sin.

00:27:39.847 --> 00:27:41.265
Don't underestimate them.

00:27:42.725 --> 00:27:44.810
You think anyone
can become an actor or an idol?

00:27:44.894 --> 00:27:46.645
They win film awards abroad,
boost our country's image,

00:27:46.729 --> 00:27:48.063
and bring in foreign revenue.

00:27:48.147 --> 00:27:50.774
They're better than most politicians
or businessmen, don't you think?

00:27:51.358 --> 00:27:52.818
So why wouldn't they be worth covering?

00:27:56.864 --> 00:27:58.908
-That's not what I meant.
-Then what is it?

00:27:59.825 --> 00:28:01.160
Do you like Lim Hyeon-jun?

00:28:01.827 --> 00:28:02.995
No, I don't!

00:28:04.246 --> 00:28:05.498
I really don't!

00:28:05.581 --> 00:28:07.166
Why are you getting worked up?

00:28:08.792 --> 00:28:10.711
Tell me now. Are you in it or not?

00:28:13.547 --> 00:28:14.757
Of course, I'm in.

00:28:15.716 --> 00:28:18.511
Please keep your promise, though.
You said three months.

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.949
-Excuse me. Hello.
-Hello.

00:28:40.908 --> 00:28:45.120
I heard from a friend
that actor Lim Hyeon-jun

00:28:45.704 --> 00:28:47.623
was brought to the ER in this hospital.

00:28:48.123 --> 00:28:51.085
-Oh, boy.
-We're not sure about that ourselves.

00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:53.337
I was just curious

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.131
because I'm a fan of Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:28:56.215 --> 00:28:57.841
We're just as curious,

00:28:57.925 --> 00:29:00.344
-but the VIP ward has very tight security.
-I see.

00:29:00.427 --> 00:29:01.428
Well,

00:29:01.512 --> 00:29:03.722
what floor is the VIP ward on?

00:29:04.807 --> 00:29:06.350
Oh dear.

00:29:06.433 --> 00:29:08.936
I was shocked
when I saw the news this morning.

00:29:09.019 --> 00:29:11.021
I'm just tired these days, that's all.

00:29:13.107 --> 00:29:15.317
I know you're busy.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.

00:29:15.401 --> 00:29:16.485
Not at all.

00:29:17.027 --> 00:29:18.737
But do you have something to tell me?

00:29:19.363 --> 00:29:20.281
Byeong-gi.

00:29:20.364 --> 00:29:21.240
Yes?

00:29:22.491 --> 00:29:24.577
Is it okay to drop honorifics with you?

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.787
Yes, please speak freely in private.

00:29:27.913 --> 00:29:30.124
I know you want to go into directing.

00:29:30.666 --> 00:29:33.752
How long will you be tied down
writing drama scripts?

00:29:33.836 --> 00:29:36.630
It's not that
I don't want to play Kang Pil-gu.

00:29:37.423 --> 00:29:41.927
I just desperately want to act
in a different role.

00:29:42.011 --> 00:29:44.013
-How much will it take?
-Excuse me?

00:29:44.096 --> 00:29:47.308
I'll lend you the money
for the building loan you took out,

00:29:47.391 --> 00:29:48.642
interest-free.

00:29:51.729 --> 00:29:52.730
Byeong-gi.

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:55.774
Give me your hand.

00:29:59.862 --> 00:30:00.779
Listen, Byeong-gi.

00:30:01.488 --> 00:30:05.909
Don't write the next season
of Kang Pil-gu, okay?

00:30:05.993 --> 00:30:08.454
Please, I'm begging you to stop.

00:30:08.537 --> 00:30:09.830
Please?

00:30:09.913 --> 00:30:12.541
I held back from saying this
in case it went to your head,

00:30:12.625 --> 00:30:15.461
but good writers like you are rare.

00:30:15.544 --> 00:30:18.505
If you refuse,
no one else can take on Kang Pil-gu.

00:30:18.589 --> 00:30:20.591
Everything will fall apart.

00:30:22.593 --> 00:30:24.011
You're not getting
any other offers anyway.

00:30:24.094 --> 00:30:25.387
I'm still seeking them.

00:30:29.183 --> 00:30:32.269
Mr. Bak, think it over the next few days.

00:30:32.811 --> 00:30:34.897
You know I'm right.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.566
Oh my goodness.

00:30:38.317 --> 00:30:40.277
-Man, this hurts.
-Right.

00:30:40.861 --> 00:30:42.529
Take care of yourself, Mr. Lim.

00:30:42.613 --> 00:30:43.614
And stay healthy.

00:30:43.697 --> 00:30:44.698
Thanks.

00:30:45.658 --> 00:30:47.409
By the way, I brought some cookies.

00:30:47.493 --> 00:30:49.578
Make sure to eat them,
even if you don't like sweets.

00:30:49.662 --> 00:30:52.956
Don't give them away.
Promise me you'll eat them.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.375
But I stopped eating carbs.

00:30:54.458 --> 00:30:56.251
You won't have energy
if you don't eat carbs.

00:30:57.544 --> 00:30:59.546
-I'll get going, then.
-Okay, thanks.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:03.175
-See you next time.
-All right. Thanks.

00:31:14.103 --> 00:31:17.898
Why would he give me cookies
after telling me to stay healthy?

00:31:18.399 --> 00:31:19.316
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5
EPISODE 1

00:31:22.444 --> 00:31:23.529
You little bastard!

00:31:23.612 --> 00:31:26.865
I called you here
to tell you not to write this,

00:31:26.949 --> 00:31:27.950
but you did it anyway!

00:31:28.701 --> 00:31:29.785
Damn it!

00:31:36.458 --> 00:31:40.671
VIP WARD

00:31:40.754 --> 00:31:44.049
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

00:31:59.857 --> 00:32:02.568
Where did you hear such an absurd rumor?

00:32:02.651 --> 00:32:05.988
You're the first reporter I'd tell
if something like that were to happen.

00:32:06.071 --> 00:32:07.197
You know that, right?

00:32:28.051 --> 00:32:30.053
Did you see him?
It's Lim Hyeon-jun, right?

00:32:30.137 --> 00:32:32.347
-Stop that. Be quiet.
-It's him, isn't it?

00:32:43.275 --> 00:32:44.193
Are you on call today?

00:32:44.777 --> 00:32:47.029
I haven't slept in two days,
so I'm about to pass out.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.531
I don't think I can go home.

00:32:50.407 --> 00:32:53.619
-Is it really Lim Hyeon-jun?
-Don't you dare tell anyone.

00:32:53.702 --> 00:32:54.995
I won't. Just hurry up and tell me!

00:32:55.078 --> 00:32:56.205
Early this morning…

00:33:02.002 --> 00:33:04.213
We've been away for too long.
Let's talk back there.

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:30.364
Why did they schedule so many tests?

00:33:30.447 --> 00:33:32.825
How should I know?
I'm just doing as I'm told.

00:33:33.534 --> 00:33:35.077
Put your hat on.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.161
-Put it on?
-Yeah.

00:33:36.245 --> 00:33:40.290
I could've been out of here by now
if it hadn't been for these tests.

00:33:40.374 --> 00:33:42.000
I'm stuck here because of those tests!

00:34:06.692 --> 00:34:08.902
VIP PATIENT ROOM

00:34:26.044 --> 00:34:27.963
Why are there so many damn tests?

00:34:28.046 --> 00:34:30.841
What's the point of all this
if I'm leaving soon anyway?

00:34:30.924 --> 00:34:33.385
Jeez, you just made a mess of things.

00:34:33.468 --> 00:34:36.096
Why did they schedule
all these useless tests?

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:40.058
-I can't leave because of them!
-I'm going to use the restroom.

00:34:43.854 --> 00:34:44.730
What the heck?

00:34:44.813 --> 00:34:45.689
What's going on?

00:34:46.523 --> 00:34:47.399
The door won't open.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:50.694
Jun?

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.740
Hello, ma'am.

00:34:54.823 --> 00:34:56.116
-Let me take that.
-Okay.

00:34:58.285 --> 00:35:01.288
Ma'am, I have to
attend to an urgent matter.

00:35:01.371 --> 00:35:03.332
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

00:35:07.127 --> 00:35:08.211
Goodness.

00:35:08.295 --> 00:35:10.714
How could you take
the wrong dose of your medicine?

00:35:10.797 --> 00:35:11.882
I told you not to come.

00:35:11.965 --> 00:35:13.842
How could I not come
when my son's in the hospital?

00:35:13.926 --> 00:35:16.261
Seon-u wanted to come,
but I knew you'd throw a fit,

00:35:16.345 --> 00:35:17.471
so I barely got him to stay.

00:35:17.554 --> 00:35:20.682
I just didn't want you
to get photographed by reporters.

00:35:20.766 --> 00:35:21.934
Jeez.

00:35:22.017 --> 00:35:24.061
-You're ashamed of me, aren't you?
-No, I'm not.

00:35:24.144 --> 00:35:26.939
I'm not ashamed at all.
Who said I was ashamed?

00:35:27.022 --> 00:35:28.774
Why would I be ashamed?

00:35:28.857 --> 00:35:30.150
You haven't eaten yet, right?

00:35:30.233 --> 00:35:33.278
-I'll prepare some fruit.
-I don't want to eat any fruit!

00:35:33.362 --> 00:35:35.364
Don't prepare any fruit!

00:35:35.447 --> 00:35:36.865
Just leave.

00:35:39.284 --> 00:35:40.577
You're old enough

00:35:41.453 --> 00:35:44.247
to know better
than to take the wrong dosage.

00:35:46.917 --> 00:35:49.044
When will he ever settle down
and get married?

00:35:54.341 --> 00:35:56.009
I still look good.

00:36:00.013 --> 00:36:02.432
Where's the knife?

00:36:09.898 --> 00:36:10.774
Who are you?

00:36:18.365 --> 00:36:19.366
Hello,

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.034
Mother.

00:36:23.286 --> 00:36:25.539
Goodness, what brings you here?

00:36:26.665 --> 00:36:27.874
Are you two dating again?

00:36:39.469 --> 00:36:42.180
She's even more shameless than I thought.

00:36:42.264 --> 00:36:44.725
Why is she here now
after leaving him so heartlessly?

00:36:45.308 --> 00:36:46.727
That nasty wench.

00:36:58.613 --> 00:37:00.157
How are you feeling?

00:37:00.657 --> 00:37:02.159
Has my pay been sorted out?

00:37:02.868 --> 00:37:05.454
Did they agree to give me double your pay?

00:37:05.537 --> 00:37:07.205
I tried my best to persuade them.

00:37:08.749 --> 00:37:12.419
-They agreed to match your pay to mine.
-Jeez.

00:37:12.502 --> 00:37:14.963
That's top pay in the industry.

00:37:15.047 --> 00:37:17.549
That's nowhere near enough.

00:37:17.632 --> 00:37:20.218
The movie shoot itself
will be a grueling ordeal.

00:37:20.302 --> 00:37:23.013
I can't do the shoot
without proper assurances.

00:37:37.152 --> 00:37:39.488
This was the first gift you gave me.

00:37:41.114 --> 00:37:42.783
We listened to it a lot together.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:50.290
I kept it this whole time.

00:37:51.041 --> 00:37:54.711
I haven't listened to it in a while
because I've been so busy,

00:37:54.795 --> 00:37:56.505
but whenever I hear this song,

00:37:56.588 --> 00:37:58.090
my heart aches a bit.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.967
Even though
I haven't listened to it in so long,

00:38:01.676 --> 00:38:03.428
I still remember all the lyrics

00:38:04.763 --> 00:38:06.098
to this song.

00:38:07.516 --> 00:38:10.143
That's how clearly
those days are etched in my memory.

00:38:13.563 --> 00:38:14.731
Why are you doing this to me?

00:38:17.567 --> 00:38:18.860
Do you still have feelings for me?

00:38:19.653 --> 00:38:20.529
Yes.

00:38:21.863 --> 00:38:22.864
A lot.

00:39:07.492 --> 00:39:10.453
JJUN-I & SSE-NA

00:39:23.842 --> 00:39:24.759
It's me.

00:39:26.094 --> 00:39:29.931
I'll go on that blind date
you mentioned before.

00:39:30.015 --> 00:39:32.100
No, I'm going to do it!

00:39:32.684 --> 00:39:34.394
Set up a date. The sooner the better!

00:39:34.978 --> 00:39:37.022
You're serious, right?
No backing out, okay?

00:39:37.898 --> 00:39:40.400
-Okay.
-The bus arriving shortly is…

00:39:44.321 --> 00:39:45.947
My brother agreed to the blind date.

00:39:47.073 --> 00:39:47.908
Yes!

00:40:08.762 --> 00:40:09.804
Oh, no.

00:40:19.439 --> 00:40:21.274
-Who's in there?
-Oh, no.

00:40:21.942 --> 00:40:24.694
What's going on? Open up, damn it!

00:40:33.995 --> 00:40:35.121
Goddamn it.

00:40:39.125 --> 00:40:41.378
Bro, your mother just left… Goodness.

00:40:42.337 --> 00:40:43.797
-What are you doing?
-I…

00:40:49.177 --> 00:40:51.096
You're unbelievable.

00:40:51.846 --> 00:40:53.265
Mr. Hwang.

00:40:53.348 --> 00:40:54.182
Sue her.

00:40:54.266 --> 00:40:58.645
-Sue her for invasion of privacy.
-That's enough.

00:40:59.312 --> 00:41:01.398
Jeez, I hope you don't get a bruise.

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.402
Ms. Wi, respectfully,
you really can't act this way.

00:41:05.485 --> 00:41:06.695
"Respectfully"?

00:41:06.778 --> 00:41:10.323
Did you just say "respectfully" to her?

00:41:10.407 --> 00:41:11.324
"Respectfully"?

00:41:12.409 --> 00:41:13.576
Come on, bro…

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.329
I mean, Hyeon-jun. Please calm down.

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:18.999
Wow.

00:41:19.082 --> 00:41:22.043
You were cursing me out not too long ago,

00:41:22.127 --> 00:41:24.421
but I guess you need me now.

00:41:25.297 --> 00:41:26.339
I must have been crazy.

00:41:26.423 --> 00:41:29.509
Why did I even bother apologizing,
knowing what you're like?

00:41:29.592 --> 00:41:32.512
If you had just cooperated with the press,

00:41:33.346 --> 00:41:34.973
I wouldn't have had to act like this.

00:41:36.433 --> 00:41:39.936
You know everyone's going wild
over your rumored suicide attempt, right?

00:41:43.857 --> 00:41:45.066
Did you really try to kill yourself?

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:48.069
Goodness, it's not like that!

00:41:48.153 --> 00:41:50.155
He took some sleeping pills
for his insomnia,

00:41:50.238 --> 00:41:54.659
but I overreacted by bringing him here,
and now everything is a mess.

00:41:54.743 --> 00:41:57.912
-Really?
-It really wasn't like that at all.

00:41:57.996 --> 00:41:59.706
Then do a proper interview.

00:41:59.789 --> 00:42:02.375
If we publish that,
it'll stop the other nonsense articles

00:42:02.459 --> 00:42:03.585
and just blow over.

00:42:04.169 --> 00:42:05.503
Wouldn't that be better?

00:42:06.504 --> 00:42:08.673
It'd at least be better
than people gossiping about you.

00:42:10.675 --> 00:42:12.635
-What should we do?
-What do you think?

00:42:12.719 --> 00:42:14.846
Even if I do an interview,
it won't be with that woman!

00:42:14.929 --> 00:42:16.222
Get me a different reporter!

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:26.358
Try to smile a little, please.

00:42:26.441 --> 00:42:29.069
-Wow, now you're directing me?
-One, two…

00:42:31.446 --> 00:42:34.366
It still looks a bit unnatural.
Try to be more natural, please.

00:42:34.449 --> 00:42:35.742
One, two…

00:42:37.869 --> 00:42:39.371
Are you kidding me?

00:42:40.288 --> 00:42:41.331
One, two…

00:42:42.749 --> 00:42:43.833
Okay, good.

00:42:44.417 --> 00:42:45.502
Did it come out well?

00:42:45.585 --> 00:42:46.795
-I guess.
-Unbelievable.

00:42:47.379 --> 00:42:48.546
Hello?

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:49.506
-Wow.
-Yes.

00:42:50.757 --> 00:42:55.178
Jeez, what the hell am I even doing?

00:42:55.261 --> 00:42:57.013
There's no need to be so angry.

00:42:57.097 --> 00:42:58.973
Politicians do this all the time.

00:42:59.057 --> 00:43:00.558
Just write the article already.

00:43:00.642 --> 00:43:03.019
I'm going to go over it word by word.

00:43:03.937 --> 00:43:06.106
The gossipy tabloid articles
will get buried, thanks to me.

00:43:06.856 --> 00:43:08.274
So don't test me.

00:43:08.817 --> 00:43:11.319
"Don't test me"?

00:43:11.403 --> 00:43:12.987
"Don't test me"?

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:17.450
-Are you talking to me?
-You started it.

00:43:31.965 --> 00:43:33.007
Sir.

00:43:40.223 --> 00:43:42.642
Say hello.
This is our newly appointed president.

00:43:45.395 --> 00:43:46.354
Nice to meet you.

00:43:49.524 --> 00:43:51.067
Are you back here for good?

00:43:51.901 --> 00:43:53.319
I'm thinking about it.

00:43:53.903 --> 00:43:56.281
I thought you wanted to
settle down in the US.

00:43:56.364 --> 00:43:58.241
That's when I was with someone.

00:44:05.165 --> 00:44:07.083
I saw your mother a few times
because of work,

00:44:07.167 --> 00:44:09.169
but she didn't say a word about you.

00:44:09.252 --> 00:44:11.504
She mentioned that you got a divorce.

00:44:12.046 --> 00:44:12.881
Did I get what I deserved?

00:44:14.424 --> 00:44:15.425
No.

00:44:19.053 --> 00:44:22.056
I don't care
whether you got divorced or not.

00:44:26.728 --> 00:44:28.938
I guess you're right.

00:44:30.398 --> 00:44:31.441
It was so long ago, after all.

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:35.069
I need to take care of something,
so I'll get going now.

00:44:35.153 --> 00:44:36.112
I need to go too.

00:44:36.696 --> 00:44:37.864
Let me head out first.

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:41.993
From now on,

00:44:43.745 --> 00:44:45.455
remember to
address me appropriately at work.

00:44:48.333 --> 00:44:49.292
Yeah, of course.

00:44:51.002 --> 00:44:52.962
Don't worry about a thing, sir.

00:45:45.765 --> 00:45:49.060
Are you two dating again?

00:46:17.046 --> 00:46:20.633
When you said you loved me

00:46:21.759 --> 00:46:23.928
And accepted me

00:46:25.138 --> 00:46:29.517
I said so confidently

00:46:29.601 --> 00:46:33.396
That I couldn't wish for anything more

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:37.775
My desires keep growing--

00:46:39.277 --> 00:46:40.320
What the heck?

00:46:42.071 --> 00:46:44.324
Why were you hiding there
without making a sound?

00:46:45.491 --> 00:46:47.118
I wasn't hiding.

00:46:47.744 --> 00:46:49.287
It was too dark for you to see me.

00:46:51.122 --> 00:46:53.416
-Why aren't you asleep at this hour?
-It's none of your business.

00:46:58.421 --> 00:47:01.299
You said you collapsed from exhaustion,
but I guess that was a lie.

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.097
Are you sure
you didn't try to kill yourself?

00:47:18.107 --> 00:47:19.275
Don't tell me

00:47:19.359 --> 00:47:20.777
you actually tried.

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:21.903
I don't know.

00:47:23.279 --> 00:47:26.157
Why do you ask?
So you can rewrite your article?

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:45.009
ROOFTOP GARDEN HOURS

00:47:48.346 --> 00:47:49.514
Do you like that song?

00:47:51.057 --> 00:47:52.058
What song?

00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:55.770
The one you just sang.

00:47:57.939 --> 00:47:59.023
What did I sing again?

00:48:00.525 --> 00:48:02.402
Do you suffer from short-term memory loss?

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:06.948
You sang that song by Kim Dong-ryul.

00:48:07.699 --> 00:48:08.533
Did I?

00:48:10.326 --> 00:48:11.744
I sang it without thinking.

00:48:17.208 --> 00:48:18.084
Why do you ask?

00:48:18.167 --> 00:48:20.628
Because I couldn't stand
listening to you sing,

00:48:20.712 --> 00:48:22.130
and to say never sing again.

00:48:23.673 --> 00:48:26.259
My brother used to play it on repeat
until it got stuck in my head.

00:48:26.843 --> 00:48:29.554
It's the only song I know how to sing.

00:48:33.266 --> 00:48:36.018
What's a fake patient like you
still doing here?

00:48:36.102 --> 00:48:37.979
If you're done with the article,
just go home.

00:48:38.062 --> 00:48:39.313
I'm not a fake patient!

00:48:39.397 --> 00:48:41.524
So you're here because you're really sick?

00:48:43.151 --> 00:48:45.528
-It's none of your business.
-Jeez.

00:48:45.611 --> 00:48:47.155
Why can't you answer my question?

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:49.073
Is there stuff you still need to cover?

00:48:49.157 --> 00:48:49.991
I know!

00:48:50.491 --> 00:48:52.034
"The 24-Hour Hospital Life
with Lim Hyeon-jun."

00:48:52.118 --> 00:48:54.328
Imagine publishing
a series of articles like that.

00:48:54.412 --> 00:48:57.957
Wow, how could you
just barge into someone's room and…

00:49:02.754 --> 00:49:03.755
Hey.

00:49:04.505 --> 00:49:05.673
Are you okay? What's wrong?

00:49:06.799 --> 00:49:07.967
You're bleeding!

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:10.928
Hey!

00:49:12.263 --> 00:49:13.347
Is anyone around?

00:49:20.813 --> 00:49:22.023
Hey!

00:49:22.565 --> 00:49:25.276
Hey, there are people out here!

00:49:32.784 --> 00:49:34.535
Are you okay? Damn it.

00:50:01.562 --> 00:50:02.563
Over here!

00:50:02.647 --> 00:50:04.190
There's a patient here!

00:50:05.399 --> 00:50:06.776
Is there a doctor anywhere?

00:50:11.239 --> 00:50:12.156
One moment.

00:50:13.366 --> 00:50:14.408
Just a moment.

00:50:19.956 --> 00:50:22.750
Jeong-sin, are you okay?

00:50:22.834 --> 00:50:26.003
-What's wrong with my sister?
-She…

00:50:26.587 --> 00:50:28.172
She collapsed all of a sudden.

00:50:28.256 --> 00:50:29.382
All of a sudden?

00:50:41.435 --> 00:50:42.353
Doctor.

00:50:42.436 --> 00:50:43.604
Is my sister okay?

00:50:43.688 --> 00:50:45.106
-This is where she had her surgery…
-One moment.

00:50:45.189 --> 00:50:46.607
We'll move her right away
for an emergency CT scan.

00:50:46.691 --> 00:50:47.942
-Yes, ma'am.
-Let's move.

00:50:48.025 --> 00:50:49.443
-Oh, no.
-Coming through!

00:50:55.324 --> 00:50:56.492
LIM HYEON-JUN'S QUICK RESPONSE

00:50:56.576 --> 00:50:57.410
LIM HYEON-JUN PERFORMS GOOD DEED

00:50:58.035 --> 00:51:01.163
I was solely focused on saving her.

00:51:01.247 --> 00:51:03.249
LIM HYEON-JUN SAVES
UNCONSCIOUS PATIENT AT HOSPITAL

00:51:03.332 --> 00:51:07.670
This is embarrassing.
I just did what anyone would've done.

00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:11.757
LIM HYEON-JUN SAVES A LIFE
"ANYONE WOULD'VE DONE THE SAME"

00:51:11.841 --> 00:51:14.343
You're one lucky man, bro.

00:51:14.427 --> 00:51:15.845
-The car is ready.
-Okay.

00:51:15.928 --> 00:51:19.140
Thanks to this,
the suicide attempt mess got buried.

00:51:20.641 --> 00:51:23.144
-So what happened to that woman?
-Who do you mean?

00:51:23.227 --> 00:51:27.398
The reporter I carried on my back,
Wi Jeong-sin or whatever.

00:51:28.149 --> 00:51:29.108
Who knows?

00:51:29.191 --> 00:51:31.360
Right, I heard Mr. Bak left you a script.

00:51:31.444 --> 00:51:32.445
How is it?

00:51:33.404 --> 00:51:35.907
I swear,
he's too diligent for his own good.

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:38.534
Why did he write the script already?

00:51:38.618 --> 00:51:42.288
-Oh, but the director turned it down--
-He's not doing it?

00:51:44.749 --> 00:51:45.958
The thing is…

00:51:46.626 --> 00:51:49.337
He's got another project
that he's working on.

00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:50.796
So he backed out of Kang Pil-gu?

00:51:51.505 --> 00:51:52.924
See? I told you!

00:51:54.008 --> 00:51:56.636
Even the director grew sick of it
after four seasons and moved on,

00:51:56.719 --> 00:51:57.887
so why can't I do the same?

00:51:57.970 --> 00:51:59.555
Let's talk when we get there.

00:51:59.639 --> 00:52:00.681
Come on, let's go.

00:52:00.765 --> 00:52:03.392
Let's talk when we get there.

00:52:04.644 --> 00:52:06.562
Ms. Wi, are you coming back
from somewhere?

00:52:08.314 --> 00:52:09.607
Have you been discharged?

00:52:10.441 --> 00:52:11.317
Yes.

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.529
What about you?

00:52:16.739 --> 00:52:17.949
The day after tomorrow.

00:52:18.032 --> 00:52:19.241
How are you…

00:52:21.118 --> 00:52:22.078
Well…

00:52:23.496 --> 00:52:25.331
You seem fine, thanks to someone.

00:52:28.417 --> 00:52:31.128
Thank you for yesterday.

00:52:34.674 --> 00:52:35.675
Jeez.

00:52:36.842 --> 00:52:38.803
After a surgery like that,

00:52:38.886 --> 00:52:41.555
you should've rested up
instead of writing an article.

00:52:42.181 --> 00:52:43.891
No one asked you
to write an article like that.

00:52:44.475 --> 00:52:45.768
It's my job.

00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:52.650
Be on your way, then.

00:52:54.485 --> 00:52:55.695
-Jeong-sin!
-Look, I--

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:04.578
Well, get well soon.

00:53:06.288 --> 00:53:07.707
See you next time, then.

00:53:14.255 --> 00:53:15.214
Over here!

00:53:15.297 --> 00:53:18.134
There's a patient here! Please help her!

00:53:30.021 --> 00:53:31.439
"Every moment I spent with you

00:53:32.189 --> 00:53:33.607
was extraordinary."

00:53:34.191 --> 00:53:35.151
"Because the weather was good,

00:53:35.234 --> 00:53:36.819
because the weather wasn't good,

00:53:36.902 --> 00:53:38.696
and because the weather was good enough,

00:53:39.697 --> 00:53:41.240
every day was good."

00:53:41.323 --> 00:53:42.491
Cut.

00:53:45.453 --> 00:53:47.246
Seriously, that was so good.

00:53:48.664 --> 00:53:52.334
Man, your acting would've brought
the Goblin to tears.

00:53:52.918 --> 00:53:55.254
-Did it come out well?
-Yeah.

00:53:55.337 --> 00:53:56.213
Let me see.

00:53:57.673 --> 00:53:59.258
Oh, I didn't hit the record button.

00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:03.554
But I did for this one here. See?

00:54:03.637 --> 00:54:05.931
Good work today, bro.

00:54:06.849 --> 00:54:08.601
Hey, have a drink.

00:54:13.355 --> 00:54:15.441
The videos are all set.

00:54:15.524 --> 00:54:18.569
We just need to send them
to local talent agencies.

00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:20.112
Want me to do it?

00:54:21.155 --> 00:54:22.656
Is your English good?

00:54:23.324 --> 00:54:24.366
No.

00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:26.869
But I know enough to send an email.

00:54:26.952 --> 00:54:27.995
No, I'll do it.

00:54:29.121 --> 00:54:30.664
You weren't going to send them, were you?

00:54:32.541 --> 00:54:34.543
I can't trust you.

00:54:34.627 --> 00:54:36.837
Fine, whatever.

00:54:38.047 --> 00:54:39.340
Hey, bro.

00:54:39.423 --> 00:54:40.966
Do you think this will really work?

00:54:42.051 --> 00:54:43.511
We might as well just go for it.

00:54:44.053 --> 00:54:45.513
Wi Jeong-sin!

00:54:46.055 --> 00:54:46.972
Hey, Jeong-sin!

00:54:48.224 --> 00:54:49.100
Jeong-sin!

00:54:52.478 --> 00:54:53.562
Are you still sleeping?

00:54:55.272 --> 00:54:56.732
Hey.

00:54:57.733 --> 00:54:59.985
Wake up. You have a blind date today.

00:55:00.694 --> 00:55:01.695
Damn it.

00:55:01.779 --> 00:55:03.197
Look at the time.

00:55:04.115 --> 00:55:06.826
And put back my clothes
once you're done wearing them!

00:55:06.909 --> 00:55:09.453
-What are you wearing today?
-Clothes.

00:55:11.372 --> 00:55:15.084
I've got my outfit planned, all right?
Don't bug me this early.

00:55:15.167 --> 00:55:16.710
Seriously.

00:55:18.087 --> 00:55:19.046
Here, look.

00:55:20.589 --> 00:55:23.551
-See? I put it together.
-This?

00:55:23.634 --> 00:55:25.386
This is the worst.

00:55:25.469 --> 00:55:28.013
Are you going to work?
This screams "Reporter Wi Jeong-sin."

00:55:28.097 --> 00:55:29.807
You'll never escape
SSB status at this rate.

00:55:29.890 --> 00:55:31.267
Hey, I put some thought into it.

00:55:33.602 --> 00:55:35.771
Man, all of these colors
are so depressing.

00:55:35.855 --> 00:55:36.939
This won't do. Follow me.

00:55:37.022 --> 00:55:39.191
Who do you think you are
ordering me around?

00:55:43.654 --> 00:55:44.947
If you want this blind date to succeed,

00:55:46.115 --> 00:55:47.825
you must trust me completely.

00:55:49.743 --> 00:55:52.246
Cut. Okay, excellent acting on my part.

00:55:52.329 --> 00:55:53.164
Hurry and get ready.

00:55:55.374 --> 00:55:56.333
Hurry up!

00:55:57.501 --> 00:55:58.711
-Hey, Su-ji.
-Yes?

00:55:58.794 --> 00:56:02.214
Recommend a blind date outfit
for a man that women tend to like.

00:56:02.298 --> 00:56:03.132
Sure.

00:56:03.215 --> 00:56:04.800
Blind date outfits these days look like…

00:56:09.722 --> 00:56:10.890
Okay.

00:56:13.809 --> 00:56:15.269
Let's see here.

00:56:15.352 --> 00:56:17.938
All right, the pants I want…

00:56:18.606 --> 00:56:20.024
-Su-ji, what hairstyles
-Yes?

00:56:20.107 --> 00:56:21.650
are popular for men these days?

00:56:21.734 --> 00:56:23.235
Popular hairstyles these days look like…

00:56:25.029 --> 00:56:27.823
I see. Something like that?

00:56:31.202 --> 00:56:33.579
Jeez, this isn't a big deal,
so why am I nervous?

00:56:34.121 --> 00:56:36.373
Maybe it's because it's been so long.

00:56:38.959 --> 00:56:40.085
-Su-ji.
-Yes?

00:56:40.169 --> 00:56:41.795
Do you think I'll do well today?

00:56:41.879 --> 00:56:43.839
I have no doubt that you'll do well.

00:56:44.423 --> 00:56:46.759
Of course, it's okay if you don't do well.

00:56:47.343 --> 00:56:50.304
Because life always gives you
another opportunity.

00:56:51.055 --> 00:56:53.432
Okay, Su-ji.

00:56:53.515 --> 00:56:55.559
-I'll try my best.
-Good luck!

00:59:28.921 --> 00:59:31.256
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YEON-SEO
FOR HER APPEARANCE

00:59:34.343 --> 00:59:35.677
Smart, intellectual, and self-sufficient.

00:59:35.761 --> 00:59:37.388
Isn't that the type you like, Hyeon-jun?

00:59:37.471 --> 00:59:40.224
What? Why would I like that type?

00:59:40.307 --> 00:59:41.850
About that reporter…

00:59:41.934 --> 00:59:43.769
There's something different
about her articles now.

00:59:44.353 --> 00:59:46.605
She used to be a political reporter?

00:59:46.688 --> 00:59:49.108
-Wait, who?
-Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:59:49.191 --> 00:59:51.402
There's hardly any information
about his private life.

00:59:51.485 --> 00:59:53.737
Is it an exclusive?
Then it'll probably cause a stir.

00:59:53.821 --> 00:59:55.406
But his family's probably in
for some rough times.

00:59:55.906 --> 00:59:58.117
Mr. Lim, did you see the article
that just came out?

00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:01.036
Doctor, I could really die, right?

01:00:05.082 --> 01:00:07.084
