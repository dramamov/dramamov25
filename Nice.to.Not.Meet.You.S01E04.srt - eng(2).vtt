00:01:28.068 --> 00:01:29.403
I'll bring you the menu.

00:01:30.487 --> 00:01:32.907
Oh, thank you.

00:01:36.827 --> 00:01:38.537
-Good work, everyone!
-Thank you!

00:01:38.621 --> 00:01:39.788
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

00:01:39.872 --> 00:01:41.624
Good work today. See you next week!

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:47.713
Do you think they met up?

00:01:48.672 --> 00:01:51.091
It's only my sister's blind date,
but I'm nervous myself.

00:01:51.675 --> 00:01:54.303
I hope it works out,
don't you agree, brother-in-law?

00:01:54.386 --> 00:01:55.554
Right.

00:01:56.555 --> 00:01:57.431
By the way,

00:01:57.514 --> 00:01:59.725
your sister's got
a strong heart and mindset, right?

00:01:59.808 --> 00:02:01.685
The war between Ukraine and Russia,

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:03.228
and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

00:02:03.312 --> 00:02:04.730
The scariest thing about all this

00:02:04.813 --> 00:02:07.191
is how part of the world has become
desensitized to such wars.

00:02:07.274 --> 00:02:09.693
No one realizes
that the once-manageable world order

00:02:09.777 --> 00:02:11.445
is now falling apart.

00:02:11.528 --> 00:02:12.738
That's why, at one point,

00:02:12.821 --> 00:02:14.990
people said a third world war
might break out.

00:02:15.074 --> 00:02:15.908
Excuse me.

00:02:16.408 --> 00:02:18.243
I heard you were a flight attendant.

00:02:18.327 --> 00:02:21.455
I didn't expect you to be
so interested in global affairs.

00:02:21.538 --> 00:02:22.748
A flight attendant?

00:02:24.583 --> 00:02:25.834
You mean like a stewardess?

00:02:28.504 --> 00:02:31.006
I'm sorry, but aren't you a detective?

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.383
A detective? Me?

00:02:33.258 --> 00:02:35.761
I'm a Grade 8 civil servant
working at the City Hall.

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.223
Aren't you a flight attendant
for Asia Airlines?

00:02:39.306 --> 00:02:40.474
Me?

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:58.450
Unbelievable.

00:02:58.534 --> 00:03:01.578
This woman has no concept of time.

00:03:01.662 --> 00:03:04.832
Seriously, how can a reporter
not show up on time to an appointment?

00:03:04.915 --> 00:03:07.001
How does she even manage to do her job?

00:03:07.084 --> 00:03:09.795
One's first impression
is key to a blind date.

00:03:09.878 --> 00:03:12.047
Just look at the time!

00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:14.216
It's so obvious why she's still single.

00:03:14.967 --> 00:03:17.761
That punk didn't even bother to tell me
her name or number,

00:03:17.845 --> 00:03:18.804
so now what?

00:03:18.887 --> 00:03:20.806
Am I supposed to leave
if she doesn't come?

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:23.350
Jeez.

00:03:24.643 --> 00:03:27.354
Tell the blind date guy
that I'm running late because of traffic.

00:03:27.438 --> 00:03:29.690
-You still haven't met up?
-You should've given me his number!

00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:32.526
I went into the wrong room
and ended up talking to a random guy!

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:33.569
Just hang up!

00:03:34.111 --> 00:03:35.362
Gosh, he's so useless.

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:38.449
Today's off to a rocky start.

00:03:39.908 --> 00:03:41.910
What's going on? They haven't met up yet?

00:03:41.994 --> 00:03:44.038
Seon-u, can you call your brother

00:03:44.121 --> 00:03:46.582
and tell him my sister's stuck in traffic,
so she'll be 30 minutes late?

00:03:46.665 --> 00:03:47.499
Sure.

00:03:50.878 --> 00:03:53.255
What did you mean when you said
my sister might be surprised?

00:03:54.048 --> 00:03:55.090
Oh, the thing is…

00:03:56.592 --> 00:03:58.427
There's something
I didn't tell you about my brother.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.678
What?

00:04:00.846 --> 00:04:04.099
Wow, that's the most cliché excuse ever!

00:04:04.183 --> 00:04:07.561
Seriously? She's stuck in traffic?

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:10.606
"Stuck in traffic"?

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:12.316
Oh, man.

00:04:18.072 --> 00:04:18.989
Yes?

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:55.818
Why are you here?

00:04:56.735 --> 00:04:58.362
Did I walk into the wrong room again?

00:05:01.448 --> 00:05:03.492
He looks like my bro Pil-gu.
Lim Hyeon-jun, that is.

00:05:03.575 --> 00:05:04.493
Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:05:04.576 --> 00:05:08.413
Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:05:10.415 --> 00:05:11.250
Hello?

00:05:13.293 --> 00:05:14.128
Don't you know me?

00:05:16.922 --> 00:05:18.132
You are…

00:05:20.968 --> 00:05:23.637
You look familiar, but…

00:05:25.514 --> 00:05:27.015
Do I know you?

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.605
She went to Hankuk University
and works as a reporter.

00:05:39.903 --> 00:05:40.863
What the heck?

00:05:42.406 --> 00:05:43.240
Are you okay?

00:05:44.241 --> 00:05:45.284
So are you saying

00:05:45.951 --> 00:05:48.036
that your older brother is Lim Hyeon-jun,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.039
and the guy who's on a blind date
with my sister right now

00:05:51.123 --> 00:05:52.124
is Kang Pil-gu?

00:05:52.207 --> 00:05:53.375
Good Detective Kang Pil-gu?

00:05:53.458 --> 00:05:56.086
I wasn't exactly lying
when I told you he was a detective.

00:06:02.384 --> 00:06:03.218
Oh, this is bad.

00:06:04.553 --> 00:06:05.596
Why?

00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:06.555
Gosh,

00:06:07.723 --> 00:06:10.559
what a small world we live in.

00:06:10.642 --> 00:06:11.727
I agree.

00:06:20.194 --> 00:06:21.069
Would you like to order?

00:06:21.153 --> 00:06:22.279
Yes, well,

00:06:22.362 --> 00:06:25.240
-it's time to eat anyway--
-I'd like an iced Americano.

00:06:25.324 --> 00:06:26.783
I'll have the same.

00:06:26.867 --> 00:06:28.160
Sure.

00:06:29.536 --> 00:06:30.746
Given the circumstances,

00:06:30.829 --> 00:06:33.332
I figured you wouldn't be
in the mood to eat.

00:06:33.415 --> 00:06:35.918
Yes, I appreciate how
you picked up on that quickly.

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:39.046
I have a friend who goes to med school.

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:40.589
It's his brother. He's a detective.

00:06:40.672 --> 00:06:42.216
I heard you were a detective.

00:06:42.299 --> 00:06:43.800
Kang Pil-gu is a detective.

00:06:43.884 --> 00:06:45.093
He's my alternate persona.

00:06:46.553 --> 00:06:48.555
Will you write an article about this too?

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:50.474
"Meeting Actor Lim Hyeon-jun
on a Blind Date"?

00:06:50.557 --> 00:06:53.310
I'm not petty enough
to write something like that.

00:06:53.936 --> 00:06:55.020
I don't quite agree.

00:06:55.604 --> 00:06:58.941
You went as far as
to comb through my social media

00:06:59.024 --> 00:07:00.484
and dig up a situationship
from three years ago.

00:07:00.567 --> 00:07:02.361
I'd say that's pretty darn petty.

00:07:05.197 --> 00:07:06.031
Well,

00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:08.325
I was blinded by revenge back then.

00:07:09.618 --> 00:07:11.536
Thank you for admitting that so quickly.

00:07:12.454 --> 00:07:13.288
Anyway,

00:07:13.372 --> 00:07:16.041
are your younger brother
and mine friends, then?

00:07:16.124 --> 00:07:17.626
Is your brother a med student too?

00:07:17.709 --> 00:07:20.295
No. He's a theater and film major.

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:23.840
Theater and film?

00:07:24.675 --> 00:07:26.718
If he finds out
we met at an acting school…

00:07:26.802 --> 00:07:28.345
My bro Pil-gu will pass out.

00:07:28.428 --> 00:07:29.846
What a cruel twist of fate.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.935
What's wrong with my brother
being a theater and film major?

00:07:36.144 --> 00:07:37.145
Nothing.

00:07:38.063 --> 00:07:41.358
But it's wrong that my brother
is hanging out with yours.

00:07:41.441 --> 00:07:43.277
You seem upset
that your med-student brother is friends

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.653
with a free spirit like my brother.

00:07:44.736 --> 00:07:46.822
You seem defensive
because your brother isn't very smart,

00:07:46.905 --> 00:07:48.323
but I didn't mean it that way.

00:07:51.076 --> 00:07:53.287
In any case, it's ridiculous how we met,

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.580
and it's even weirder to call this fate.

00:07:55.664 --> 00:07:57.124
"Fate"?

00:07:57.207 --> 00:07:59.835
I think it'd be best
that we part ways now.

00:07:59.918 --> 00:08:00.794
I think so too.

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:04.089
Hey, I'm heading out first.

00:08:09.428 --> 00:08:11.138
EPISODE 4

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.299
Come on, does she not have an umbrella?

00:08:47.883 --> 00:08:49.551
Whatever, it's not my problem.

00:09:03.774 --> 00:09:06.234
Oh, boy. She's getting soaked.

00:09:06.318 --> 00:09:08.362
And that dress looks new.

00:09:08.945 --> 00:09:12.282
Seriously, why isn't she taking a taxi?

00:09:19.498 --> 00:09:21.333
Yes, there we go.

00:09:21.416 --> 00:09:23.085
Go ahead and buy it.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.964
PRICE 19,900 WON

00:09:39.976 --> 00:09:41.311
Is she not going to buy it?

00:09:41.395 --> 00:09:44.106
It probably doesn't even cost that much.
Just buy it already!

00:09:49.152 --> 00:09:49.986
Thank you.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.156
Why is she running like that
when she only just had her surgery?

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.699
Her stomach must still hurt.

00:09:57.702 --> 00:09:59.871
Fine, I'll give her a ride.

00:10:07.295 --> 00:10:08.463
Jeez.

00:10:54.426 --> 00:10:55.469
Are you back?

00:10:57.679 --> 00:10:58.513
-Why?
-What?

00:10:58.597 --> 00:10:59.806
Trust you completely?

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.808
Jeong-sin, please calm down!

00:11:01.892 --> 00:11:04.352
I swear, I didn't know
his brother was Pil-gu!

00:11:04.853 --> 00:11:08.273
Exchanging photos or numbers
would've given him away on social media.

00:11:08.356 --> 00:11:10.984
Seon-u said it'd take away
the excitement before the date.

00:11:11.067 --> 00:11:13.153
I didn't realize
he was trying to hide his identity.

00:11:28.668 --> 00:11:30.337
How did the blind date go anyway?

00:11:30.837 --> 00:11:32.506
How do you think it went?

00:11:33.006 --> 00:11:35.133
Well, you showed up
looking your absolute best.

00:11:35.217 --> 00:11:37.302
-Did Pil-gu fall in love at first sight--
-What?

00:11:40.138 --> 00:11:42.140
I mean, you wrote
nice articles about him recently,

00:11:42.224 --> 00:11:44.351
and my bro Pil-gu saved your life.

00:11:44.434 --> 00:11:45.644
That's why I asked.

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:48.563
Wait, why are you a mess?

00:11:48.647 --> 00:11:50.774
My bro Pil-gu didn't even
offer you a ride home in this rain?

00:11:52.442 --> 00:11:54.361
Why would he offer me a ride?

00:11:56.988 --> 00:11:58.073
What a shame.

00:11:58.865 --> 00:12:00.367
I could've been his brother-in-law.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:01.535
"Brother-in-law"?

00:12:02.035 --> 00:12:02.869
Get over here.

00:12:02.953 --> 00:12:04.955
Brother-in-law, my ass!

00:12:05.038 --> 00:12:07.123
Stop hitting me!
I was just trying to help!

00:12:09.668 --> 00:12:12.337
I didn't know you and my friend's sister
already knew each other.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.547
No.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.215
No, let's not talk about that.

00:12:15.298 --> 00:12:18.510
Tell me where you met
that friend of yours, Hong-sin.

00:12:18.593 --> 00:12:21.137
-Why do you ask?
-I asked where you met him.

00:12:22.597 --> 00:12:24.266
You already know the answer.

00:12:24.849 --> 00:12:27.060
So you seriously want to be an actor?

00:12:28.144 --> 00:12:30.188
Have you lost your mind?

00:12:30.689 --> 00:12:33.316
I held back so I wouldn't seem like
I was fishing for credit,

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.736
but I even picked up delivery
and warehouse jobs on weekends

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.697
while working at the print shop.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.199
All because I was afraid my smart brother
couldn't afford med school!

00:12:41.283 --> 00:12:42.909
I bent over backwards
so you wouldn't feel small!

00:12:42.993 --> 00:12:43.868
Do you know that?

00:12:44.786 --> 00:12:45.787
Yeah, I do.

00:12:47.539 --> 00:12:49.749
I know you paid for the expensive academy
despite our family's situation,

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.668
and that you bought me nice things

00:12:51.751 --> 00:12:53.545
so I wouldn't feel small
around my friends.

00:12:53.628 --> 00:12:55.171
Thanks to you taking on a father's role,

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.382
I grew up wanting for nothing.

00:12:57.465 --> 00:12:58.758
You know all that,

00:12:59.718 --> 00:13:02.721
yet you lied to Mom and me
and took a break from school?

00:13:03.471 --> 00:13:04.389
I'm sorry for lying to you.

00:13:04.472 --> 00:13:07.142
But I really want to be an actor,
Hyeon-jun.

00:13:08.727 --> 00:13:10.312
Do I make acting look easy to you?

00:13:10.395 --> 00:13:13.440
Do you know
how many celebrity family members

00:13:13.523 --> 00:13:15.275
tried to debut after gaining attention,
only to fail?

00:13:15.358 --> 00:13:17.152
I have no intention of relying on you!

00:13:17.235 --> 00:13:20.196
Besides, it's not like our family ties
are something we can brag about.

00:13:22.115 --> 00:13:24.326
Having different fathers
isn't something to be proud of.

00:13:27.037 --> 00:13:27.996
Hey, you punk!

00:13:29.789 --> 00:13:31.082

You're not having lunch?

00:13:41.343 --> 00:13:42.177
I'll skip it today.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.219
Okay.

00:13:44.971 --> 00:13:45.889
Wait for me!

00:15:15.645 --> 00:15:16.563
Right, bro.

00:15:16.646 --> 00:15:19.107
Did you hear back
from that American agency?

00:15:20.442 --> 00:15:23.445
They're so slow
that they haven't even read my email yet.

00:15:23.945 --> 00:15:26.698
All big-name companies are like that.

00:15:26.781 --> 00:15:28.074
Oh, right.

00:15:28.158 --> 00:15:30.243
Did you read the article Ms. Wi wrote?

00:15:30.326 --> 00:15:32.620
All those articles
about that old dating rumor

00:15:32.704 --> 00:15:35.749
and your unmannerly travel behavior
got totally buried by it.

00:15:35.832 --> 00:15:36.666
Really?

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.209
About that reporter.

00:15:38.293 --> 00:15:40.128
There's something different
about her articles now.

00:15:40.712 --> 00:15:45.341
She connects your drama character
with your real self

00:15:45.425 --> 00:15:48.470
and writes with such depth.

00:15:49.095 --> 00:15:51.389
I think we should treat her to a meal.

00:15:51.473 --> 00:15:52.766
Don't be ridiculous.

00:16:02.484 --> 00:16:04.652
It really is a small world.

00:16:04.736 --> 00:16:07.113
-What? Why?
-It's nothing.

00:16:07.197 --> 00:16:11.201
In any case, we're getting
tons of calls from advertisers!

00:16:11.284 --> 00:16:12.202
Jeez.

00:16:12.994 --> 00:16:14.704
First, she tries to bury me,
then she saves me.

00:16:14.788 --> 00:16:17.415
She has a knack for creating a problem,
then solving it.

00:16:17.999 --> 00:16:20.752
-Treat her to a meal if you have time.
-Okay.

00:16:21.336 --> 00:16:23.379
By the way, bro,

00:16:23.463 --> 00:16:26.382
there will be tons of reporters
at today's ramyeon promotion.

00:16:26.466 --> 00:16:29.511
You won't kick Ms. Wi
out of the event, will you?

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.639
Hey, I'm not irrational.

00:16:34.682 --> 00:16:36.768
Why do you still have your clothes on?
Aren't you getting the massage?

00:16:38.228 --> 00:16:40.438
Oh, I'm out of shape right now.

00:16:41.147 --> 00:16:42.190
I'm too embarrassed.

00:16:46.277 --> 00:16:47.153
Hello.

00:16:53.701 --> 00:16:55.537

Hey.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.503
What about Director Shin Gwang-su?

00:17:05.129 --> 00:17:07.257
He's a total sociopath.

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.008
I worked with him when I was a rookie.

00:17:09.092 --> 00:17:12.136
He teaches you
the true meaning of verbal abuse.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.430
Then what about Director Cha Dong-man?

00:17:14.514 --> 00:17:17.016
-The one who did The Villain's Equation?
-Yeah.

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:19.519
You haven't watched it, have you?
The directing was a mess!

00:17:20.311 --> 00:17:22.021
Then who will you work with?

00:17:22.105 --> 00:17:24.148
We have to get ready for filming now!

00:17:24.232 --> 00:17:26.860
Don't get worked up.
You'll end up with wrinkles.

00:17:26.943 --> 00:17:29.529
Getting wrinkles
isn't the problem right now!

00:17:29.612 --> 00:17:31.865
The broadcasting station
will think I'm a liar!

00:17:31.948 --> 00:17:34.576
Hey, let's calm down.

00:17:34.659 --> 00:17:37.370
Mr. Lim, there's a great article
about you right now.

00:17:37.453 --> 00:17:39.247
We should release the program schedule

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:40.999
when your public image is at its peak.

00:17:44.002 --> 00:17:45.753
We'd like to finish up here, please.

00:17:58.516 --> 00:18:00.518
I'll admit it's a well-written article.

00:18:02.478 --> 00:18:03.354
It really is.

so keep up the good work.

-Fine, I was just asking.

When you were covering
Lim Hyeon-jun at the hospital,

00:19:53.631 --> 00:19:55.633
did you see any women visiting him?

00:20:02.515 --> 00:20:03.558
No, I didn't.

so I put together a feature
on the '70s and '80s erotic film actors.

There we go.

00:20:19.407 --> 00:20:21.784

00:20:32.128 --> 00:20:33.129
What is it?

00:20:33.212 --> 00:20:35.548
She looks like Lim Hyeon-jun's mother.

00:20:36.382 --> 00:20:39.302
-I think I saw her in his hospital room.
-It can't be.

00:20:39.385 --> 00:20:41.971
Now that you mention it,
they do resemble each other.

00:20:42.055 --> 00:20:43.681
Look at their eyes and how they smile.

00:20:45.683 --> 00:20:48.311
-I see the resemblance.
-I think you're right.

-They do look alike.
-You have a good eye.

00:20:50.396 --> 00:20:52.815
-They look alike, right?
-The resemblance is there.

00:20:53.941 --> 00:20:55.818
Do you think that's her,
or do you know for sure?

00:20:55.902 --> 00:20:57.070
I want a straight answer.

00:20:57.153 --> 00:20:58.654
I can't be sure with just this one photo.

00:20:58.738 --> 00:20:59.989

Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:21:03.326 --> 00:21:05.578
There's hardly any information
about his private life.

00:21:05.661 --> 00:21:08.498
But if his mother used to be
an erotic film actress back in the day,

00:21:08.581 --> 00:21:09.582
that's big news.

00:21:10.374 --> 00:21:12.418
-Look into it.
-Pardon me?

00:21:12.502 --> 00:21:15.421

00:21:32.021 --> 00:21:34.482
I think we're bothering Lim Hyeon-jun
too much with his private life.

00:21:35.358 --> 00:21:37.610
Do you have a grudge against him?

00:21:37.693 --> 00:21:40.321
What if I do? Does that change anything?

00:21:40.404 --> 00:21:41.614

Is that the extent of your imagination
as a reporter?

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.460
I'm covering an event
Lim Hyeon-jun's doing today.

00:21:55.253 --> 00:21:56.254
Don't go, then.

00:21:56.337 --> 00:21:58.923
Running into him after the article's out
won't do you any good.

00:21:59.006 --> 00:22:00.007
But…

00:22:04.762 --> 00:22:07.515
I heard my outdoor clothing advertisement
went to another actor.

00:22:08.641 --> 00:22:09.475
Who is it?

00:22:10.101 --> 00:22:11.102
Byeon Woo-seok.

00:22:13.563 --> 00:22:17.692
That's why I need to do
a luxury brand or suit commercial,

00:22:17.775 --> 00:22:21.529
not just shooting hearts
in a ramyeon commercial.

00:22:21.612 --> 00:22:23.322
Come on, don't say that.

00:22:23.406 --> 00:22:24.824
It was supposed to be a one-off,
six-month contract,

00:22:24.907 --> 00:22:27.577
but they made it long-term
and even raised the modeling fee.

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:28.995
You should be thanking the advertiser.

00:22:29.078 --> 00:22:32.623
I'm the one modeling for them,
so the advertiser should be thanking me.

00:22:33.708 --> 00:22:35.209
They invited a ton of reporters.

00:22:35.293 --> 00:22:36.711
I was worried there wouldn't be many.

00:22:36.794 --> 00:22:38.045
Why would you worry about that?

00:22:40.381 --> 00:22:41.757

00:24:32.952 --> 00:24:34.453
but my brother's the one who runs it.

00:24:34.537 --> 00:24:39.000
I'm just a salaried president,
someone who could get fired any day.

00:24:39.083 --> 00:24:40.918
Oh, I see.

00:24:41.002 --> 00:24:43.296
Wow, I can't believe
we're meeting like this again.

00:24:43.379 --> 00:24:46.173
Who knew this could happen in real life?
This is pretty cool.

00:24:47.258 --> 00:24:48.467
I know, right?

00:24:49.427 --> 00:24:50.469
By the way,

00:24:51.429 --> 00:24:53.597
why were you
watching that movie back there?

00:24:55.016 --> 00:24:57.101
It was for a feature article.

00:24:57.184 --> 00:25:00.646
The theme is something like
erotic film actors of the past.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:02.064
I see.

00:25:04.775 --> 00:25:05.860
Oh, right.

00:25:05.943 --> 00:25:07.862
How's your injury
from back at the airport?

00:25:07.945 --> 00:25:10.573
I'm perfectly fine now, thanks to you.

00:25:12.575 --> 00:25:14.952
Well, it looks like
I'll be seeing you around a lot.

00:25:38.309 --> 00:25:41.312
SEONG AE-SUK, THE MYSTERIOUS ACTRESS
AND THE THREE SHADOWS SHE LEFT BEHIND

00:25:44.231 --> 00:25:46.317
"THE GODMOTHER,"
MOTHERLY LOVE OR A BUSINESS TRANSACTION?

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.527
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FEMALE CHARACTER

00:25:54.241 --> 00:25:56.118
THE SCENT OF THE MIRROR

00:26:22.311 --> 00:26:23.646
ACTOR LIM HYEON-JUN REVEALED
AS SON OF '70S SEX ICON, SEONG AE-SUK

00:26:23.729 --> 00:26:26.941
Lim Hyeon-jun's
ramyeon promotion event starts at 7 p.m.,

00:26:27.024 --> 00:26:28.567
and the press conference
is at 8 p.m., right?

00:26:28.651 --> 00:26:32.071
I'll release the article at 7:50 p.m.,
right before the press conference.

00:26:32.154 --> 00:26:33.948
We can't give him time
to prepare a response.

00:26:38.285 --> 00:26:39.620
Why do you look so uneasy?

00:26:41.872 --> 00:26:42.873
Chief.

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.544
Shouldn't we confirm the facts
with his agency first?

00:26:47.711 --> 00:26:49.171
-I already did.
-So it's true?

00:26:49.255 --> 00:26:50.381
Yes.

00:26:50.965 --> 00:26:54.093
I don't think
King's Back Entertainment will hold back.

00:26:54.176 --> 00:26:56.720
Will your connection
with Mr. Hwang be okay?

00:26:56.804 --> 00:26:57.763
Lim Hyeon-jun

00:26:57.847 --> 00:27:00.891
boosted his public image
and got plenty of commercial offers

00:27:00.975 --> 00:27:03.727
after carrying you on his back
following his suicide attempt.

00:27:03.811 --> 00:27:05.563
So what if his mom
is an erotic film actress?

00:27:05.646 --> 00:27:07.648
Is he some idol singer with a huge fandom,

00:27:07.731 --> 00:27:09.984
or a golden child
who goes to Hankuk University?

00:27:10.067 --> 00:27:13.612
No, he's the rough and righteous
Detective Kang Pil-gu.

00:27:13.696 --> 00:27:16.198
He stepped up as the head of the family
and got them back on their feet,

00:27:16.282 --> 00:27:17.992
like any average Korean man would do.

00:27:18.576 --> 00:27:19.660
What does he stand to lose?

00:27:21.579 --> 00:27:22.913
Probably nothing,

00:27:23.956 --> 00:27:25.416
but his family's probably in
for some rough times.

00:27:26.208 --> 00:27:29.253
Don't waste time worrying about that,
and focus on your job.

00:27:30.796 --> 00:27:31.630
Right.

00:27:32.214 --> 00:27:34.842
Change Lim Hyeon-jun's photo
to one that makes him look pathetic.

00:27:42.475 --> 00:27:44.602
THE MISHIK ARTISAN RAMYEON

00:27:44.685 --> 00:27:45.853
THE MISHIK ARTISAN RAMYEON

00:27:50.483 --> 00:27:52.067
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:27:53.903 --> 00:27:55.863
Wow, look at all these people.

00:28:07.041 --> 00:28:07.875
Is she not here?

00:28:07.958 --> 00:28:10.711
-What? Who?
-What?

00:28:11.295 --> 00:28:14.173
Never mind. Where's the waiting room?

00:28:14.673 --> 00:28:16.091
-Over there.
-It's over there.

00:28:16.175 --> 00:28:17.343
Thanks.

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:21.805
-You're all done.
-Thank you.

00:28:21.889 --> 00:28:23.849
-Great job.
-Thank you.

00:28:25.559 --> 00:28:27.102
So how do you feel?

00:28:28.229 --> 00:28:29.605
You don't look so good.

00:28:31.106 --> 00:28:32.358
Want an herbal calming pill?

00:28:34.318 --> 00:28:35.694
-Okay.
-Good.

00:28:35.778 --> 00:28:40.157
-Don't be so nervous, all right?
-I'm not nervous at all.

00:28:40.241 --> 00:28:41.784
Mr. Lim, please stand by.

00:28:41.867 --> 00:28:42.701
Okay, thank you.

00:28:45.162 --> 00:28:47.206
-You've got this!
-Right.

00:28:47.289 --> 00:28:49.833
Let's give a big hand
to Actor Lim Hyeon-jun,

00:28:49.917 --> 00:28:51.293
the face of Artisan Ramyeon!

00:29:01.679 --> 00:29:02.513
Thank you.

00:29:21.907 --> 00:29:24.285
Oh, you're still here.

00:29:26.036 --> 00:29:27.288
Yes.

00:29:27.371 --> 00:29:29.039
Why the long face?

00:29:29.582 --> 00:29:31.041
You look upset.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:34.962
Did you do something bad?

00:29:35.045 --> 00:29:36.338
No, I didn't!

00:29:38.591 --> 00:29:40.759
Would you like to join me for dinner
if you haven't eaten yet?

00:29:56.066 --> 00:29:57.651
Why do you keep checking your watch?

00:29:58.444 --> 00:30:01.655
-Do I?
-You check your watch, then sigh.

00:30:01.739 --> 00:30:03.032
You've been doing that nonstop.

00:30:04.199 --> 00:30:05.618
Are you really that bored with me?

00:30:05.701 --> 00:30:07.411
No, it's not like that.

00:30:08.621 --> 00:30:11.081
My article's about to be published soon.

00:30:11.165 --> 00:30:12.416
Is it an exclusive?

00:30:13.083 --> 00:30:14.752
Most likely, yes.

00:30:15.252 --> 00:30:17.004
-Then it'll probably cause a stir.
-Yes.

00:30:17.796 --> 00:30:19.214
The world is a mess,

00:30:19.798 --> 00:30:21.175
and I bet Lim Hyeon-jun will be too.

00:30:25.262 --> 00:30:26.138
He's an actor, right?

00:30:26.764 --> 00:30:27.598
Yes.

00:30:30.017 --> 00:30:33.562
My mother's actually
a pretty famous actress herself.

00:30:35.648 --> 00:30:38.567
There used to be
a nasty reporter who kept writing

00:30:38.651 --> 00:30:40.444
aggressive articles about my mother.

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.322
I used to hate that reporter, you know.

00:30:43.822 --> 00:30:47.660
Then, I got an opportunity
to talk to that reporter in private.

00:30:47.743 --> 00:30:51.163
And they turned out to be
a very good-natured person.

00:30:51.664 --> 00:30:52.998
That's when I realized…

00:30:54.958 --> 00:30:57.169
"My mother was just doing her job,

00:30:57.252 --> 00:30:59.505
just as the reporter was doing theirs."

00:31:03.258 --> 00:31:05.469
All I'm saying is
that you were just doing your job.

00:31:06.053 --> 00:31:07.930
So don't be too hard on yourself.

00:31:12.559 --> 00:31:15.729
Mr. Lee, you're a very good person.

00:31:16.563 --> 00:31:18.482
It's like the first day we met.

00:31:19.608 --> 00:31:20.693
It's as if you decided

00:31:21.443 --> 00:31:23.946
that you'd always be a good person to me,

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:25.906
no matter what.

00:31:28.951 --> 00:31:29.785
Thank you.

00:31:33.872 --> 00:31:35.874
I'll get going now.
Thank you for the dinner.

00:31:35.958 --> 00:31:36.834
Of course.

00:31:42.548 --> 00:31:44.925
Hello, is this King's Back Entertainment?

00:31:45.008 --> 00:31:46.635
This is Wi Jeong-sin from Sports Eunseong.

00:31:46.719 --> 00:31:48.637
Could I get Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun's
contact information?

00:31:48.721 --> 00:31:50.180
Mr. Hwang isn't answering.

00:31:50.973 --> 00:31:52.808
I'm asking because this is urgent.

00:31:52.891 --> 00:31:54.810
I need to tell him something.
In just a few minutes…

00:31:56.895 --> 00:31:57.938
I understand.

00:32:13.787 --> 00:32:15.998
PUBLISH REQUEST

00:32:16.081 --> 00:32:16.957
APPROVED

00:32:34.016 --> 00:32:35.934
We kindly ask everyone to remain quiet.

00:32:36.477 --> 00:32:40.022
We will now begin the press conference.

00:32:40.105 --> 00:32:42.024
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun,
please proceed to the table.

00:32:50.616 --> 00:32:53.535
Please raise your hand
if you have any questions.

00:32:53.619 --> 00:32:55.120
Yes, the reporter over there.

00:32:55.204 --> 00:32:58.749
Season five of Good Detective Kang Pil-gu
is set to be produced.

00:32:58.832 --> 00:32:59.875
Has this been confirmed?

00:33:01.168 --> 00:33:05.130
I'm here to introduce Artisan Ramyeon,

00:33:05.214 --> 00:33:08.801
so I'd appreciate it if you could hold off
on any questions about Kang Pil-gu.

00:33:08.884 --> 00:33:10.177
The next reporter, please.

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.263
Do you have any special tips
on how to enjoy ramyeon?

00:33:13.347 --> 00:33:17.017
I'd say just follow the instructions
on the back of the package.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:18.811
It tastes best that way.

00:33:18.894 --> 00:33:20.938
There's a reason for those instructions.

00:33:21.021 --> 00:33:22.314
The reporter in the front.

00:33:22.397 --> 00:33:23.857
I'm Park Seung-won from Sunday Sports.

00:33:23.941 --> 00:33:26.401
Mr. Lim, did you see the article
that just came out?

00:33:26.485 --> 00:33:29.780
It says your mother is Seong Ae-suk,
an erotic film actress from the '70s.

00:33:30.489 --> 00:33:33.158
Did you plan on revealing that your mother
was an erotic film actress?

00:33:33.242 --> 00:33:35.369
Do you still keep in touch with Ms. Seong?

00:33:35.452 --> 00:33:38.038
Are you denying
that your mother was in erotic films?

00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:40.499
How long have you known
that Ms. Seong was in erotic films?

00:34:19.037 --> 00:34:19.913
Hyeon-jun!

00:34:20.497 --> 00:34:23.000
-What's wrong?
-Sir!

00:34:23.083 --> 00:34:25.586
-Hey, call 119!
-Right.

00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:28.922
-Gil-su.
-Yeah?

00:34:29.006 --> 00:34:31.675
Don't call 119.

00:34:32.718 --> 00:34:33.594
Damn it.

00:34:36.054 --> 00:34:37.306
Stay with me now.

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:39.766
Come on, help me massage his arms.

00:35:05.167 --> 00:35:06.460
Did you plan on revealing that your mother

00:35:06.543 --> 00:35:09.212
-was an erotic film actress?
-Is Ms. Seong your biological mother?

00:35:09.296 --> 00:35:10.964
Tell us your thoughts on Ms. Seong's past…

00:35:11.048 --> 00:35:12.841
Do you admit that your mother
was an erotic actress?

00:35:12.925 --> 00:35:14.343
Are you proud of your mother?

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:24.102
What is it? What's wrong?

00:35:24.186 --> 00:35:26.188
-Mr. Hwang.
-Yes?

00:35:34.404 --> 00:35:36.073
-Mr. Hwang.
-Yes?

00:35:36.823 --> 00:35:38.367
Where's that hospital you mentioned?

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:39.493
I need to pay a visit.

00:35:50.837 --> 00:35:51.713
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun?

00:35:53.674 --> 00:35:54.967
-Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun!
-Yes?

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:56.343
Please head up to the doctor's office.

00:35:56.426 --> 00:35:57.302
Okay.

00:36:01.348 --> 00:36:03.600
Your anxiety score is twice
that of a normal person and…

00:36:03.684 --> 00:36:04.851
I have a panic disorder, right?

00:36:04.935 --> 00:36:08.355
Panic disorder isn't diagnosed
after just one panic attack.

00:36:08.438 --> 00:36:10.399
This must have affected your daily life.

00:36:10.482 --> 00:36:11.650
You said your heart raced,

00:36:11.733 --> 00:36:13.819
-and you had trouble breathing?
-Yes.

00:36:14.361 --> 00:36:15.696
I almost died.

00:36:15.779 --> 00:36:17.531
I couldn't breathe at all,

00:36:17.614 --> 00:36:20.075
so I really thought I was going to die.

00:36:20.158 --> 00:36:22.703
I was lucky this time
because there were people around me.

00:36:22.786 --> 00:36:25.330
Had I been alone,
I would've died for sure.

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:27.582
Doctor.

00:36:27.666 --> 00:36:29.126
If something like this happens again,

00:36:29.626 --> 00:36:31.670
I could really die, right?

00:36:31.753 --> 00:36:33.630
No. You won't die from a panic disorder.

00:36:33.714 --> 00:36:36.717
Technically, it just feels like
you can't breathe.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.344
But in reality, you actually can.

00:36:42.014 --> 00:36:43.974
How many hours do you sleep a day?

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:45.934
Well…

00:36:47.394 --> 00:36:51.148
-About three or four hours.
-The quality of sleep you get

00:36:51.231 --> 00:36:53.608
-also affects panic attacks--
-Excuse me, Doctor.

00:36:54.359 --> 00:36:57.904
Could this all be due to past trauma?

00:36:57.988 --> 00:36:59.865
I went to a restaurant a few days ago…

00:36:59.948 --> 00:37:01.324
PLEASE SAVE ME!

00:37:01.408 --> 00:37:03.577
…and a knife attack incident
occurred there.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.997
But everyone was just looking at me.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:10.333
I mean, I'm not really Kang Pil-gu.
I'm Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:37:10.417 --> 00:37:12.461
-How could I face someone with a knife--
-Mr. Lim?

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:14.963
-Yes?
-Talking about the past

00:37:15.047 --> 00:37:16.757
won't help manage
your panic disorder right now.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:20.677
And psychiatric treatment
isn't something that works overnight.

00:37:21.178 --> 00:37:23.930
I'm sorry, but can you finish your story
at our next consultation?

00:37:25.724 --> 00:37:28.060
At our next consultation?

00:37:28.685 --> 00:37:30.228
So…

00:37:31.063 --> 00:37:32.522
is that it for today?

00:37:32.606 --> 00:37:34.399
Yes, your time is up.

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:45.077
How'd it go?

00:37:46.328 --> 00:37:48.497
What kind of doctor is that?

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.123
I mean, shouldn't a psychiatrist

00:37:50.207 --> 00:37:53.752
really look into their patient's mind
and observe them carefully?

00:37:53.835 --> 00:37:55.295
Was she really that bad?

00:37:55.378 --> 00:37:57.798
She was awful! I need to see someone else.

00:38:00.217 --> 00:38:01.176
Maybe she didn't recognize me.

00:38:03.637 --> 00:38:04.888
Anyway,

00:38:04.971 --> 00:38:06.973
that reporter, Wi Jeong-sin…

00:38:07.557 --> 00:38:08.975
Where is she right now?

00:38:09.059 --> 00:38:11.436
The thing is…

00:38:18.401 --> 00:38:20.946
Mr. Lee, you're a very good person.

00:38:21.029 --> 00:38:21.863
It's as if you decided

00:38:21.947 --> 00:38:24.574
that you'd always be a good person to me,

00:38:25.534 --> 00:38:26.827
no matter what.

00:38:36.545 --> 00:38:37.546
Hey, you.

00:38:41.133 --> 00:38:42.259
Get in.

00:38:48.265 --> 00:38:50.100
Are you some kind of erotic film maniac?

00:38:50.183 --> 00:38:52.477
How did you recognize my mom immediately?

00:38:53.061 --> 00:38:54.980
I saw her in a photo
while working on a feature

00:38:55.063 --> 00:38:56.022
about erotic film actors.

00:38:56.106 --> 00:38:57.816
Fine. That's good and all,

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:02.445
but shouldn't you have apologized by now
if you had any conscience at all?

00:39:03.405 --> 00:39:04.322
You see…

00:39:06.533 --> 00:39:08.493
Shouldn't we confirm the facts
with his agency first?

00:39:08.577 --> 00:39:09.953
I already did.

00:39:12.372 --> 00:39:15.292
You're not here for an apology.
You're here to be mad at me.

00:39:16.418 --> 00:39:17.419
Wow.

00:39:18.587 --> 00:39:21.756
I knew you were cruel,
but it's still shocking.

00:39:22.257 --> 00:39:25.051
How could you go after my family
and still have such nerve?

00:39:25.927 --> 00:39:27.971
Don't reporters have parents or siblings?

00:39:28.638 --> 00:39:31.725
Reporters aren't some PR staff
who only write to your liking.

00:39:33.059 --> 00:39:35.979
It was an article anyone else
would've written at any time.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:39.983
It's best to acknowledge it
and be upfront about it.

00:39:40.692 --> 00:39:42.277
Don't pretend like you care.

00:39:43.945 --> 00:39:44.905
But…

00:39:45.822 --> 00:39:47.407
why is it even something to hide?

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:50.493
Are you that ashamed of your own mother?

00:39:54.915 --> 00:39:56.583
I mean, it's 2025.

00:39:56.666 --> 00:39:59.586
It's an era where people support
single moms by choice and gay marriage.

00:39:59.669 --> 00:40:01.838
People are more open-minded
than you think.

00:40:02.631 --> 00:40:06.301
-You're so outdated.
-What? Outdated?

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:08.053
I don't get you.

00:40:09.221 --> 00:40:13.350
Right, I guess that's why
you're so good at leading a double life.

00:40:13.433 --> 00:40:15.977
After all, no job is considered
inferior these days,

00:40:16.061 --> 00:40:19.439
so it's only natural that people
in your line of work are supported.

00:40:20.148 --> 00:40:22.442
What do you mean by "your line of work"?

00:40:25.362 --> 00:40:26.821
Don't you remember me?

00:40:26.905 --> 00:40:28.573
Not from the red carpet.

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:34.955
Not from the airport.

00:40:41.044 --> 00:40:44.631
Did we run into each other
somewhere else too?

00:40:45.131 --> 00:40:46.216
At the hostess bar.

00:40:46.299 --> 00:40:48.009
In the restroom.

00:40:49.177 --> 00:40:50.971
I'm really sorry,
but I'm going to have to step on you.

00:40:53.765 --> 00:40:55.225
My leg! Watch my neck!

00:40:58.103 --> 00:40:58.979
Then you're…

00:40:59.896 --> 00:41:01.898
You're the man from the restroom?

00:41:04.359 --> 00:41:05.694
Now do you remember?

00:41:05.777 --> 00:41:07.821
That's right. It was me.

00:41:10.323 --> 00:41:11.950
I'm really sorry about that night.

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:14.703
I owe you an apology. I'm really sorry.

00:41:17.956 --> 00:41:19.082
Are you really a reporter?

00:41:19.165 --> 00:41:20.250
-Look here.
-Goodness.

00:41:20.333 --> 00:41:22.377
Do you know what happens
if you impersonate a reporter?

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:23.712
Excuse me?

00:41:23.795 --> 00:41:27.507
There's no way this woman is a reporter.

00:41:28.091 --> 00:41:28.925
Wait.

00:41:30.593 --> 00:41:33.388
Did you think
I was one of the hostesses there?

00:41:33.471 --> 00:41:34.431
Jeez.

00:41:34.514 --> 00:41:36.641
Are you saying you were dressed like that

00:41:36.725 --> 00:41:39.936
to do some undercover reporting
or something like that?

00:41:46.943 --> 00:41:48.820
What if I was?

00:41:57.954 --> 00:42:01.416
I'm the one who's pissed off,
so why is she the one getting mad?

00:42:08.715 --> 00:42:09.924
Unbelievable.

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.314
But…

00:42:24.898 --> 00:42:26.066
why is it even something to hide?

00:42:26.149 --> 00:42:28.068
Are you that ashamed of your own mother?

00:42:29.235 --> 00:42:31.654
Man, today was so…

00:42:36.034 --> 00:42:37.327
Right.

00:42:41.414 --> 00:42:44.417
Wow, I got two responses already.

00:42:51.466 --> 00:42:55.303
MAYBE NEXT TIME

00:42:56.221 --> 00:42:57.347
Oh, well.

00:42:58.181 --> 00:42:59.432
You can't expect to make it
on the first try.

00:42:59.516 --> 00:43:01.935
All right, next.

00:43:02.852 --> 00:43:03.812
YOU DID NOT GET THE ROLE

00:43:15.073 --> 00:43:17.283
It's me, Se-na.
Are you feeling better now?

00:43:19.411 --> 00:43:20.995
IT'S ME, SE-NA.
ARE YOU FEELING BETTER NOW?

00:43:34.551 --> 00:43:36.636
I mean, it's 2025.

00:43:36.719 --> 00:43:40.140
It's an era where people support
single moms by choice and gay marriage.

00:43:40.223 --> 00:43:42.308
People are more open-minded
than you think.

00:43:42.392 --> 00:43:45.478
It's best to acknowledge it
and be upfront about it.

00:43:51.651 --> 00:43:54.404
"RETIRED ACTRESS SEONG AE-SUK
BACK IN THE SPOTLIGHT, THANKS TO HER SON"

00:43:54.487 --> 00:43:56.322
Why is this even something to hide?

00:43:56.406 --> 00:43:58.408
Are you that ashamed of your own mother?

00:44:12.881 --> 00:44:13.882
Jun!

00:44:14.757 --> 00:44:15.675
Jun!

00:44:24.601 --> 00:44:26.436
-Jun!
-Hey.

00:44:31.065 --> 00:44:32.358
It's too early for this.

00:44:33.026 --> 00:44:34.527
I'm so tired.

00:44:34.611 --> 00:44:36.779
It's like I ran off
in the middle of the night.

00:44:36.863 --> 00:44:38.781
What's all that?

00:44:39.324 --> 00:44:41.493
I'll be in the US for the time being.

00:44:42.076 --> 00:44:45.246
Everyone is giving me shit,
saying I'm ruining your future.

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:46.331
What did I even do?

00:44:46.414 --> 00:44:48.208
Forget it.

00:44:48.291 --> 00:44:51.169
Everyone already knows,
so just stay in Korea.

00:44:53.087 --> 00:44:54.339
Fine.

00:44:54.422 --> 00:44:57.342
I guess I have no choice
but to do what you tell me.

00:44:58.635 --> 00:45:02.472
That reporter who wrote about me,
what's her deal with you?

00:45:02.555 --> 00:45:04.474
Seon-u told me that wench was the one

00:45:04.557 --> 00:45:06.643
who wrote about the sushi incident
and dating rumors.

00:45:06.726 --> 00:45:09.646
That's enough. Don't call her a wench.

00:45:09.729 --> 00:45:13.024
Reporters don't have to act like PR
and write only nice things about me.

00:45:13.107 --> 00:45:14.692
She actually wrote
a nice article about him

00:45:14.776 --> 00:45:16.069
when he was in the hospital.

00:45:19.239 --> 00:45:22.116
She'd better stay out of my way,
or else I'll beat her to a pulp!

00:45:24.202 --> 00:45:26.579
You don't have to living in hiding anymore
thanks to that article.

00:45:26.663 --> 00:45:30.083
You should be thanking her, if anything.

00:45:30.166 --> 00:45:32.585
Are you siding with
that reporter right now?

00:45:33.753 --> 00:45:36.005
Why would I take that woman's side?

00:45:38.591 --> 00:45:40.134
By the way, aren't those yours?

00:45:40.635 --> 00:45:41.970
Oh, these?

00:45:42.053 --> 00:45:43.346
I'm here to live with you.

00:45:43.429 --> 00:45:44.847
-To live with me?
-Yes.

00:45:44.931 --> 00:45:45.807
Why?

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:48.393
You took the wrong dose of your meds
and wound up in the hopsital.

00:45:48.476 --> 00:45:50.103
Someone needs to keep an eye on you.

00:45:50.186 --> 00:45:52.564
Jeez, I can take care of myself!

00:45:52.647 --> 00:45:53.773
No.

00:45:53.856 --> 00:45:55.984
Have Seon-u stay with you
for at least a month.

00:45:56.067 --> 00:45:57.694
If something like that happens again,

00:45:58.695 --> 00:46:00.280
you'll send me to an early grave.

00:46:01.239 --> 00:46:03.658
Come on, Hyeon-jun.
I won't get in your way.

00:46:09.372 --> 00:46:10.373
Fine.

00:46:11.332 --> 00:46:12.625
But just for a month.

00:46:13.501 --> 00:46:16.004
You can use the room at the end,
so go unpack your stuff.

00:46:16.087 --> 00:46:17.130
Okay.

00:46:22.635 --> 00:46:23.845
I need to know something.

00:46:24.679 --> 00:46:25.555
Who's the father?

00:46:26.848 --> 00:46:27.849
Your father's dead.

00:46:28.933 --> 00:46:29.976
Not Seon-u's dad.

00:46:30.059 --> 00:46:32.604
I'm not talking about my stepfather.
Who's my real father?

00:46:35.023 --> 00:46:37.817
I told you your father is dead too.

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:42.447
They say you retired after having a child
with a conglomerate family,

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:43.906
and that I'm the child.

00:46:45.992 --> 00:46:48.453
Do you think I would've left him
if that were true?

00:46:48.536 --> 00:46:51.414
I'd have taken his money somehow
and spared you two all that suffering.

00:47:20.151 --> 00:47:22.028
Fine. That's good and all,

00:47:22.654 --> 00:47:26.491
but shouldn't you have apologized by now
if you had any conscience at all?

00:47:27.158 --> 00:47:28.326
Whatever.

00:47:34.499 --> 00:47:35.625
This is Wi Jeong-sin speaking.

00:47:36.834 --> 00:47:37.877
Yes.

00:47:40.171 --> 00:47:41.089
Wait, who?

00:47:53.059 --> 00:47:54.811
How long are you going to keep at this?

00:47:54.894 --> 00:47:56.145
I'm not close to being done.

00:47:56.854 --> 00:47:58.106
Move out of the way.

00:48:02.652 --> 00:48:04.946
I'll keep it a secret from Mom
for the time being,

00:48:05.029 --> 00:48:06.155
so go back to school next semester.

00:48:06.239 --> 00:48:07.824
Can I try for a year before I go back?

00:48:08.533 --> 00:48:10.034
Let it go.

00:48:10.118 --> 00:48:13.663
I know better than anyone
how hard you studied.

00:48:13.746 --> 00:48:16.666
But you want to pretend
none of it happened to take a risk.

00:48:17.291 --> 00:48:18.501
I can't support that.

00:48:20.002 --> 00:48:21.713
Just go back to school after the break.

00:48:25.258 --> 00:48:27.927
At least give me some time
to think about it.

00:48:31.806 --> 00:48:32.890
Fine, then.

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:38.980
By the way, don't you want to
meet up with that reporter again?

00:48:39.731 --> 00:48:40.940
She's actually your type.

00:48:41.023 --> 00:48:42.650
She's smart, intellectual,
and self-sufficient.

00:48:43.401 --> 00:48:45.820
-Jeez.
-Aren't her looks your type too?

00:48:49.031 --> 00:48:51.784
What? Why would I like that type?

00:48:51.868 --> 00:48:54.537
Gosh, what do you even know about my type?

00:48:56.372 --> 00:48:57.331
Are you okay?

00:49:03.463 --> 00:49:05.423
MESSAGES

00:49:19.312 --> 00:49:20.855
You should've been more careful.

00:49:20.938 --> 00:49:22.273
Get some rest, okay?

00:49:26.819 --> 00:49:29.447
Oh, jeez.

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:31.824
Nothing's going my way.

00:49:31.908 --> 00:49:34.076
Is this my sign
to go see a fortune teller?

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:34.994
THE CARD OF DESTINY

00:49:35.077 --> 00:49:36.871
An online tarot card reading?

00:49:36.954 --> 00:49:39.290
This is available online now?

00:49:41.626 --> 00:49:42.668
OK-JI

00:49:42.752 --> 00:49:45.338
Hello. I'm your tarot consultant, Ok-ji.

00:49:46.464 --> 00:49:47.507
Oh, right.

00:49:48.341 --> 00:49:49.175
Hello.

00:49:49.258 --> 00:49:50.885
What would you like to know?

00:49:50.968 --> 00:49:53.554
I've been on a bad luck streak lately.

00:49:54.138 --> 00:49:57.016
When do you think things will get better?

00:49:57.099 --> 00:49:59.977
You're asking with regard
to people and work, right?

00:50:00.061 --> 00:50:03.314
-Yes, that's right.
-Do you see the tarot cards at the bottom?

00:50:03.397 --> 00:50:05.900
-I do.
-Choose nine cards in total.

00:50:11.531 --> 00:50:14.992
Do you see the card with the men
beating each other with sticks?

00:50:15.076 --> 00:50:16.828
This represents your current situation.

00:50:16.911 --> 00:50:18.996
In other words, a dogfight.

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:22.416
There are endless fights breaking out,
both internally and externally.

00:50:23.167 --> 00:50:26.379
-You're absolutely right.
-The second card is

00:50:26.462 --> 00:50:27.630
three months in the future.

00:50:27.713 --> 00:50:30.091
Just like the swords piercing the heart
and leaving holes,

00:50:30.174 --> 00:50:32.802
you'll also experience a heartache,
with holes in your own heart.

00:50:32.885 --> 00:50:34.512
Right, holes.

00:50:35.012 --> 00:50:36.389
What should I do, then?

00:50:36.472 --> 00:50:38.140
Based on the last card,

00:50:38.224 --> 00:50:39.851
instead of being considerate,

00:50:39.934 --> 00:50:43.229
it might be best to act
in your self-interest.

00:50:43.938 --> 00:50:46.649
Also, do you have lower back pain?

00:50:46.732 --> 00:50:48.901
Yes, how did you know?

00:50:48.985 --> 00:50:53.197
People who pull the Ten of Swords
usually have lower back pain.

00:50:53.281 --> 00:50:56.534
Man, it's like you're psychic!

00:50:56.617 --> 00:50:57.618
I'm not a psychic.

00:50:58.661 --> 00:51:01.038
In any case, the cards tell me

00:51:01.122 --> 00:51:04.834
that these messy situations
are likely to continue for the time being.

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.798
I have one more thing I'd like to ask.

00:51:10.882 --> 00:51:14.093
The work I do
is going really well these days,

00:51:14.176 --> 00:51:16.596
but to be honest,
I want to try something different.

00:51:16.679 --> 00:51:19.473
My current work
doesn't seem to offer any growth,

00:51:19.557 --> 00:51:22.101
and I feel like I'm being complacent.

00:51:24.604 --> 00:51:25.688
Do you think

00:51:27.064 --> 00:51:30.109
it'd be okay for me
to start something new?

00:51:30.693 --> 00:51:33.070
Right now, I think it's best

00:51:33.154 --> 00:51:36.157
that you continue what you're doing,
rather than trying something new.

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.658
Don't let greed take over.

00:51:37.742 --> 00:51:39.327
The cards tell me

00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:42.204
that if you succeed
in what you're doing now,

00:51:42.288 --> 00:51:43.998
it'll lead to better opportunities.

00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:47.043
What do you know?

00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:57.970
Meet me at Rozan Cafe at 8 o'clock.

00:51:58.054 --> 00:51:59.305
Rozan Cafe at 8 o'clock?

00:52:01.933 --> 00:52:05.019
-You really don't want to do that movie?
-I told you no!

00:52:05.102 --> 00:52:06.604
-Just because Se-na's in it?
-I'm not doing it!

00:52:06.687 --> 00:52:08.189
You'll have to do Kang Pil-gu, then.

00:52:08.272 --> 00:52:10.441
Do what?
They haven't even found a new director.

00:52:11.442 --> 00:52:12.902
Speaking of which,

00:52:12.985 --> 00:52:15.279
let's meet the director first.

00:52:15.363 --> 00:52:16.405
Which director?

00:52:16.489 --> 00:52:19.408
If I tell you,
the first thing you'll do is refuse!

00:52:19.492 --> 00:52:22.119
Just meet the director and talk, okay?

00:52:22.203 --> 00:52:25.206
I'm going crazy being the middleman!

00:52:25.289 --> 00:52:26.499
Damn it.

00:52:26.582 --> 00:52:29.418
You always bring me here
when you want something out of me.

00:52:32.088 --> 00:52:33.506
Don't let greed take over.

00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:36.133
"Right now, I think it's best

00:52:36.217 --> 00:52:39.136
that you continue what you're doing,
rather than trying something new."

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:40.680
That's what the cards say.

00:52:40.763 --> 00:52:43.766
I was determined not to do it,
no matter what.

00:52:45.685 --> 00:52:46.894
But I'll do it for you.

00:52:47.478 --> 00:52:49.605
Okay, fine. Let's do that for now and…

00:52:50.564 --> 00:52:51.774
What did you say?

00:52:51.857 --> 00:52:53.901
You'll do it?

00:52:53.985 --> 00:52:55.069
I said I will.

00:52:55.152 --> 00:52:56.612
You're serious, right?

00:52:57.113 --> 00:52:59.365
Hold on, I need to record this.

00:52:59.448 --> 00:53:00.324
I'm recording this.

00:53:00.408 --> 00:53:01.701
-Go ahead!
-Yeah?

00:53:01.784 --> 00:53:04.662
-Go right on ahead!
-Look, I pressed the button.

00:53:04.745 --> 00:53:06.789
Will you really do Kang Pil-gu?

00:53:06.872 --> 00:53:09.667
I, Lim Hyeon-jun, swear to perform

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:12.545
in season five of Kang Pil-gu,
no matter what!

00:53:12.628 --> 00:53:14.380
Okay!

00:53:18.676 --> 00:53:19.552
Happy now?

00:53:48.122 --> 00:53:49.040
Are you Bahn Soo-jung?

00:53:49.623 --> 00:53:50.666
How do you know me?

00:53:51.208 --> 00:53:53.044
Thank you for coming.

00:53:53.127 --> 00:53:55.713
But what made you contact me?

00:53:56.547 --> 00:53:59.383
You seemed like the type of person
who keeps promises.

00:54:00.634 --> 00:54:01.677
Call this number.

00:54:01.761 --> 00:54:04.889
Your 12-year-old sister
who's been bedridden with a rare illness.

00:54:05.473 --> 00:54:07.558
There must be a way
for you to take care of her

00:54:07.641 --> 00:54:09.393
without having to work here.

00:54:12.563 --> 00:54:13.647
Thanks to you,

00:54:13.731 --> 00:54:16.484
my sister is receiving treatment now.

00:54:16.567 --> 00:54:18.819
-So you don't work there anymore, right?
-Yes.

00:54:19.987 --> 00:54:22.239
Anyway, why did you want to see me?

00:54:25.367 --> 00:54:26.911
I'm just too scared

00:54:27.787 --> 00:54:29.413
to keep this to myself.

00:54:31.916 --> 00:54:34.168
About that video I handed over to you…

00:54:34.752 --> 00:54:37.630
The script is amazing as usual.

00:54:37.713 --> 00:54:39.840
Mr. Bak is truly impressive.

00:54:39.924 --> 00:54:42.218
-The big plot twist here
-Yeah?

00:54:42.301 --> 00:54:44.136
is how the good detective Kang Pil-gu

00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:46.889
-turns into a corrupt one.
-That's right.

00:54:46.972 --> 00:54:51.560
You have no idea how grateful we are
that you made this decision.

00:54:52.144 --> 00:54:54.605
You basically saved all of us!

00:54:54.688 --> 00:54:56.899
Who will give him a role
in a melodrama or rom-com at his age?

00:54:56.982 --> 00:54:58.859
He's stuck with Kang Pil-gu.

00:55:03.614 --> 00:55:05.032
Don't mention it.

00:55:06.784 --> 00:55:07.910
I should be thanking you.

00:55:07.993 --> 00:55:09.370
No, not at all!

00:55:11.413 --> 00:55:13.457
Anyway, is the director not coming?

00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:16.085
Mr. Bak isn't here yet, either.

00:55:18.129 --> 00:55:20.714
Oh, they'll arrive together.

00:55:20.798 --> 00:55:21.841
-Right.
-Yes.

00:55:21.924 --> 00:55:23.926
-Together?
-Yes.

00:55:24.009 --> 00:55:26.595
Now I'm dying to know who it is.
Just tell me already.

00:55:26.679 --> 00:55:28.055
Jeez.

00:55:28.139 --> 00:55:30.057
Come on, Mr. Hwang.

00:55:30.141 --> 00:55:30.975
Hello!

00:55:31.058 --> 00:55:32.143
Hey.

00:55:32.726 --> 00:55:34.436
-Come on in.
-Hey, Mr. Bak.

00:55:35.563 --> 00:55:38.315
Where's the director?
I thought you were coming together.

00:55:40.442 --> 00:55:41.944
You haven't told him yet?

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:45.573
Tell me what?

00:55:48.742 --> 00:55:51.245
What's going on?
What's with the sudden mood change?

00:56:01.172 --> 00:56:02.298
Could it be…

00:56:09.388 --> 00:56:10.890
Don't tell me he…

00:56:14.268 --> 00:56:15.269
Tell me I'm wrong.

00:56:15.352 --> 00:56:16.437
Mr. Bak said he'll do it.

00:56:19.481 --> 00:56:20.524
He'll do it?

00:56:21.984 --> 00:56:22.860
Do what?

00:56:27.031 --> 00:56:27.865
Directing.

00:56:28.449 --> 00:56:30.534
For this season of Kang Pil-gu,

00:56:30.618 --> 00:56:32.995
we decided that Mr. Bak
could write and direct it.

00:56:40.461 --> 00:56:41.587
You…

00:56:44.798 --> 00:56:46.008
You're going to direct it?

00:56:47.801 --> 00:56:49.178
I'll do my best, Mr. Lim!

00:56:49.803 --> 00:56:50.763
Take it quickly.

00:56:50.846 --> 00:56:51.847
Toss it down.

00:56:52.431 --> 00:56:54.099
Cut. Again.

00:56:54.183 --> 00:56:55.017
Cut!

00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:56.727
Ready. Action!

00:56:56.810 --> 00:56:59.355
Cut. Ready. Action!

00:57:01.023 --> 00:57:02.149
Cut! Don't stop.

00:57:02.233 --> 00:57:03.984
Keep acting until I say cut.

00:57:04.068 --> 00:57:06.278
It seems you didn't fully prepare
for the character,

00:57:06.362 --> 00:57:08.739
so we'll stop and reshoot this later.

00:57:08.822 --> 00:57:11.742
It's not like you've worked with
those directors either, Mr. Lim.

00:57:11.825 --> 00:57:13.118
Action!

00:57:13.202 --> 00:57:16.413
Had I known you were so bad at acting,
I wouldn't have persuaded you.

00:57:16.997 --> 00:57:18.040
I hope…

00:57:18.123 --> 00:57:21.919
we never see each other again,
you little shit!

00:58:01.875 --> 00:58:04.420
About that video I handed over to you…

00:58:05.421 --> 00:58:08.173
There was one more person
who wasn't in it.

00:58:17.141 --> 00:58:19.435
Someone really famous.

00:58:27.985 --> 00:58:28.819
Gwon Se-na.

00:59:47.981 --> 00:59:50.234
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YEON-SEO
FOR HER APPEARANCE

00:59:53.404 --> 00:59:54.822
You said it's your first time
at a baseball stadium, right?

00:59:54.905 --> 00:59:57.741
-Let's watch together after the interview.
-Okay.

00:59:58.325 --> 01:00:02.079
How am I supposed to write the article
if you only give me short answers?

01:00:02.621 --> 01:00:04.331
I'm meeting Ms. Wi. Are you coming?

01:00:04.415 --> 01:00:07.084
Today's shoot will finish
before 6 p.m., right?

01:00:07.167 --> 01:00:08.585
-It's 6 o'clock.
-It's 6 o'clock?

01:00:09.628 --> 01:00:11.130
How much further? How much longer?

01:00:11.213 --> 01:00:12.798
Let's hurry up, okay?

01:00:13.590 --> 01:00:14.425
It's been a while.

01:00:15.008 --> 01:00:16.218
I know a place we can go.

01:00:16.301 --> 01:00:18.720
It's dark and secluded.

01:00:19.388 --> 01:00:21.140
Where…

01:00:24.935 --> 01:00:26.937
