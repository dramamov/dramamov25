WEBVTT

00:00:01.789 --> 00:00:02.959
Director Ko.

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:04.929
Wait.

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:08.199
Eun Oh? What are you doing at the police station?

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:36.429
It can't be...

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.399
No.

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.639
This is impossible.

00:01:08.089 --> 00:01:09.089
Director Ko!

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.399
Director Ko!

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:32.519
This feels like a dream.

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:34.349
This has to be a dream.

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:00.609
It wasn't a dream.

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:08.149
Please calm down.

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:11.289
I'm sorry.

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:13.719
You were right in front of me, and I didn't even recognise you.

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.259
I should have looked harder.

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:39.179
I don't know where to begin.

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.099
Your name was...

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.199
Han Yu Ra.

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:01.639
Han...

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:03.509
Yu Ra?

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:07.479
But hold on.

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.349
Didn't you say you were adopted from an orphanage in Cheongju?

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.649
- Yes. - Cheongju?

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:17.449
How?

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:20.419
You disappeared in Busan. How did you end up there?

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:27.929
So someone must have taken you.

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:34.939
I combed through every inch of Busan.

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:38.069
On the off chance,

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.409
I went down every single alley...

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.309
I can't believe she's my birth mother.

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:51.349
How could I, with my own daughter right in front of me...

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:55.959
I mean, we met so many times. How could I not have recognised you?

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:59.359
Even after you told me yourself you were adopted.

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:01.159
I...

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:05.499
I don't know my birth parents.

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.109
My younger brother just found out that I was adopted.

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.909
He says he doesn't see me as family anymore.

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:18.609
I always thought...

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:24.689
I thought I'd know you on sight. I'm a terrible mother.

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:27.889
Please, don't say that.

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:32.059
I was definitely drawn to you.

00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:35.429
We got along so well, and I thought you were wonderful.

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:38.429
Why didn't it ever cross my mind?

00:04:41.299 --> 00:04:42.309
I...

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:46.039
I still feel like I'm dreaming.

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:51.109
When the lady said she was taking you to the market,

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.819
I should never have let you go.

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:58.149
I had to leave one of my twins...

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:01.419
with my neighbour...

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:04.929
and carried the other on my back while I sold insurance door-to-door.

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:08.029
Oh, right.

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:11.469
- I'm a twin? - Growing up,

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:14.939
you weren't mistreated, were you? Were they really good to you?

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:17.069
Where did you live?

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:19.309
So where did you live, and until when?

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:23.049
I know you studied computer science and worked at Doogle,

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:26.549
and that you switched to interior design, but...

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.849
What elementary school did you go to?

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:29.949
How about middle school?

00:05:30.549 --> 00:05:31.549
Oh, right.

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.989
What happened with your younger brother?

00:05:37.489 --> 00:05:39.459
I couldn't bring myself to ask before.

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:40.899
He's...

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:43.929
back home now.

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:46.269
He's back?

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.539
He must be giving you a hard time.

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:53.009
No, not at all.

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:55.879
He came back a lot more mature.

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:57.649
I see.

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:04.789
(Team Meeting)

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:08.019
I'm sorry.

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:11.459
I have a team meeting scheduled for today.

00:06:13.359 --> 00:06:14.529
You do?

00:06:15.429 --> 00:06:19.969
Of course. You should go, then. You can't miss a meeting for work.

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:25.509
But what about you, Director Ko?

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:29.979
You came to the hospital in an ambulance.

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:32.519
That's right.

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:35.749
I'll get a cab to the police station.

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:37.349
You go on ahead.

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:41.789
Okay.

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:47.229
Tomorrow,

00:06:48.429 --> 00:06:49.969
are you free?

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:55.339
We barely had any time today.

00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:05.719
By the way,

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:09.589
why are you dressed so lightly?

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:22.159
It doesn't feel real.

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:26.469
How can she be my mom?

00:07:27.099 --> 00:07:29.809
How is a coincidence like this even possible?

00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:34.179
It just doesn't feel real.

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:41.349
You mean the director?

00:07:42.149 --> 00:07:45.149
The director who hired you to design the art space?

00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:49.659
- Yes. - She's your birth mother? For real?

00:07:51.089 --> 00:07:52.289
Unbelievable, right?

00:07:53.899 --> 00:07:55.559
How is that even possible?

00:07:56.869 --> 00:08:00.239
That elegant and sophisticated woman is your birth mom.

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:02.039
So what was it like for you?

00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:04.039
How did you feel?

00:08:05.239 --> 00:08:09.509
You know how much I admired her.

00:08:10.349 --> 00:08:11.779
I wanted to be just like her.

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:14.719
So you were happy about it.

00:08:17.019 --> 00:08:19.019
It's not like I hated it.

00:08:20.289 --> 00:08:21.289
It's just that...

00:08:21.789 --> 00:08:25.129
I've never really thought much about my birth parents,

00:08:25.829 --> 00:08:28.799
and for someone so incredible to suddenly be my birth mother...

00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:31.269
I just couldn't believe it.

00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:37.439
And do you know what she's really like?

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:39.679
By the way,

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:43.209
why are you dressed so lightly?

00:08:49.619 --> 00:08:50.819
I was worried that...

00:08:54.789 --> 00:08:56.759
my daughter...

00:08:57.189 --> 00:08:59.899
might have struggled a lot after I lost her.

00:09:00.699 --> 00:09:02.729
And if I, her mother, showed up...

00:09:03.029 --> 00:09:06.639
looking comfortable and well-dressed, it could hurt her.

00:09:07.969 --> 00:09:08.969
So...

00:09:10.609 --> 00:09:13.109
I wore the same clothes I had on...

00:09:14.379 --> 00:09:15.809
the day I lost you.

00:09:19.249 --> 00:09:21.619
Isn't she so thoughtful and warm?

00:09:22.049 --> 00:09:24.749
My gosh. It is truly incredible that she kept...

00:09:24.819 --> 00:09:27.419
the clothes she wore the day she lost her daughter all this time.

00:09:40.999 --> 00:09:42.369
What a relief.

00:09:46.909 --> 00:09:49.549
It's done. Finally.

00:09:57.319 --> 00:10:00.619
Su Jeong. Why is everyone in the office so down?

00:10:02.489 --> 00:10:03.829
Because of Ji Hyuk.

00:10:04.329 --> 00:10:07.399
Boyang Construction betrayed us, and the AP Group deal fell through.

00:10:08.659 --> 00:10:12.129
- What? When? - Yesterday afternoon.

00:10:13.469 --> 00:10:17.369
Mr. Lee turned his phone off, and no one's heard from him since.

00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:21.609
Yesterday afternoon?

00:10:22.109 --> 00:10:23.109
I'm hungry.

00:10:25.449 --> 00:10:26.779
Will you eat with me?

00:10:28.049 --> 00:10:30.219
I'm not really hungry right now.

00:10:36.629 --> 00:10:37.629
All right. Never mind.

00:10:47.039 --> 00:10:49.269
So that's why he was like that yesterday.

00:10:50.439 --> 00:10:52.169
I should've at least had a meal with him.

00:10:55.809 --> 00:10:58.479
He should have just told me. How could he just leave?

00:11:05.189 --> 00:11:09.289
(CEO Lee Ji Hyuk)

00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:15.659
The phone is turned off. Transferring to voicemail.

00:11:36.289 --> 00:11:39.789
What's been happening that's made him look like a ghost?

00:11:51.229 --> 00:11:55.469
What makes you think you can just take over a huge company like AP?

00:11:55.569 --> 00:11:57.539
Why are you so desperate to hit the jackpot?

00:11:57.609 --> 00:11:59.009
Dad, please...

00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:01.709
We had an agreement, Dad.

00:12:03.109 --> 00:12:05.579
Just pretend you don't know anything.

00:12:07.249 --> 00:12:08.449
Fine.

00:12:09.049 --> 00:12:11.119
He doesn't want me interfering.

00:12:12.089 --> 00:12:14.119
I guess that's just how business is.

00:12:14.989 --> 00:12:16.929
Going bankrupt can happen in a flash.

00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:19.899
So what if he couldn't get that huge company?

00:12:20.329 --> 00:12:22.329
He'll be upset for a while, but that's all.

00:12:23.029 --> 00:12:24.769
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

00:12:25.699 --> 00:12:29.239
Turnkey requests are piling up, so we need more designers.

00:12:29.809 --> 00:12:30.969
How many more should we...

00:12:35.239 --> 00:12:36.249
Ms. Ji?

00:12:38.009 --> 00:12:40.179
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:12:40.919 --> 00:12:43.519
I was lost in thought for a moment.

00:12:44.189 --> 00:12:47.759
It's fine. But all the employees are looking to the CEO,

00:12:48.359 --> 00:12:49.759
so it's only natural that you're worried.

00:12:50.589 --> 00:12:51.659
About Mr. Lee...

00:12:52.259 --> 00:12:53.829
He'll pull himself together soon.

00:12:58.499 --> 00:12:59.839
(Ggang Oh)

00:13:00.439 --> 00:13:03.339
- You should answer it. - Thanks.

00:13:07.379 --> 00:13:09.409
- Hey, Ggang Oh. - Eun Oh!

00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:11.709
Why? What's up? What's going on?

00:13:11.779 --> 00:13:14.879
You know how the HQ tasting team came to try our galbi?

00:13:15.079 --> 00:13:17.219
They've officially added it to the HQ menu!

00:13:19.089 --> 00:13:20.159
Really?

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:26.999
When should we go on our first date? This weekend?

00:13:27.659 --> 00:13:28.659
How about tomorrow?

00:13:28.929 --> 00:13:31.029
I have a new product meeting, so I can do 1pm.

00:13:31.399 --> 00:13:33.899
- Does that work for you? - Yes, that's perfect.

00:13:39.679 --> 00:13:40.709
What's wrong with this?

00:13:41.709 --> 00:13:43.179
Gosh, seriously.

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:46.619
Everything has to be perfect today.

00:13:48.549 --> 00:13:50.819
From 1pm to midnight.

00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:53.759
Just like Cinderella.

00:13:54.289 --> 00:13:57.689
Oh, it's 19cm? Perfect.

00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:05.699
Gosh, why is this spreading out so much?

00:14:06.599 --> 00:14:09.139
Why can't I get the shape of this egg right?

00:14:13.179 --> 00:14:15.109
Why doesn't this taste like Mom's?

00:14:17.609 --> 00:14:18.779
(Lee Su Bin)

00:14:18.779 --> 00:14:20.019
Hey, I'm here.

00:14:22.849 --> 00:14:23.849
Oh, boy.

00:14:27.059 --> 00:14:28.919
Why did she tell me to meet her here?

00:14:40.139 --> 00:14:41.299
What is all this?

00:14:41.969 --> 00:14:43.509
Hey, sit down. Take your shoes off.

00:14:44.869 --> 00:14:46.339
No, really, what is this?

00:14:48.579 --> 00:14:49.579
A picnic.

00:14:50.149 --> 00:14:51.149
A picnic?

00:15:02.759 --> 00:15:03.929
What, am I a kid?

00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:06.059
Where did you buy this kiddie lunch box?

00:15:06.299 --> 00:15:08.529
I didn't buy it. I made it all myself.

00:15:08.799 --> 00:15:09.799
It's cute, right?

00:15:10.099 --> 00:15:13.639
- You made all this? Really? - Yes.

00:15:13.899 --> 00:15:16.839
No way. Your mom must have made it for you.

00:15:17.769 --> 00:15:18.939
No, she didn't.

00:15:19.209 --> 00:15:22.379
I was stressing about what to say if anyone asked me about the gimbap,

00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:25.709
but my mom and grandma left at 9am for their appointments.

00:15:26.249 --> 00:15:27.779
The moment they left,

00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:29.749
I started cooking and didn't take a single break.

00:15:31.419 --> 00:15:32.619
Here, try some.

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:36.989
Hey, why would you go through all this trouble?

00:15:37.429 --> 00:15:39.129
I'm supposed to be the one treating you.

00:15:39.459 --> 00:15:40.499
They say,

00:15:40.599 --> 00:15:42.759
"Devote yourself and get tossed out like an old shoe."

00:15:43.699 --> 00:15:44.829
Are you always like this?

00:15:45.429 --> 00:15:48.139
No, this is the first time I've ever made gimbap.

00:15:48.469 --> 00:15:51.009
I never even cooked for my exes.

00:15:51.369 --> 00:15:52.569
Then why go to all this trouble?

00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:56.809
Because you've got the upper hand. I wanted to impress you.

00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:08.089
No, I just wanted you to have gimbap made with lots of love.

00:16:08.359 --> 00:16:10.059
I figured when you were growing up...

00:16:14.699 --> 00:16:18.299
You were too busy with fancy food to enjoy homemade meals like this.

00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:22.069
You're right.

00:16:22.599 --> 00:16:24.939
It's my first time having homemade, busted-open gimbap.

00:16:25.309 --> 00:16:26.309
What?

00:16:31.149 --> 00:16:33.149
I was sure I only packed the ones that weren't falling apart.

00:16:34.379 --> 00:16:36.549
It all falls apart in your mouth anyway.

00:16:39.689 --> 00:16:40.959
It's seriously good, though.

00:16:42.019 --> 00:16:43.759
Really? Thank goodness.

00:16:45.929 --> 00:16:46.929
What's this?

00:16:48.929 --> 00:16:50.729
Did you make this cute little thing too?

00:16:51.729 --> 00:16:53.699
Here, have some soup with it.

00:17:00.279 --> 00:17:03.149
What's with her today? She looks kind of different.

00:17:04.209 --> 00:17:05.209
What?

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:09.889
Do I have something on my face?

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:11.349
Su Bin...

00:17:14.759 --> 00:17:16.259
I never knew you had freckles.

00:17:16.889 --> 00:17:18.259
Freckles?

00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:23.029
Oh, no.

00:17:24.769 --> 00:17:26.399
I forgot to put on makeup.

00:17:26.999 --> 00:17:29.809
Gosh, why didn't I put on makeup? I didn't even do my hair...

00:17:29.939 --> 00:17:31.169
This is a disaster!

00:17:35.139 --> 00:17:36.179
Don't wear makeup.

00:17:37.009 --> 00:17:39.179
You know, you actually look prettier without makeup.

00:17:58.369 --> 00:18:00.139
No, I take that back.

00:18:00.869 --> 00:18:01.899
You look better with makeup.

00:18:02.599 --> 00:18:04.509
Make sure you wear makeup when you see your boyfriend.

00:18:05.469 --> 00:18:07.009
Hey, but seriously, you're great at making gimbap.

00:18:20.559 --> 00:18:22.219
Man, I'm stuffed.

00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:25.359
You know, back in the US, I used to eat sandwiches outside.

00:18:26.129 --> 00:18:27.599
But this is my first gimbap picnic.

00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:31.899
- This is nice. - Yes? This is just the appetizer.

00:18:32.269 --> 00:18:33.439
Just wait for the next course.

00:18:33.899 --> 00:18:36.639
The next course? What is this, an omakase?

00:18:36.709 --> 00:18:38.409
Hey, I'm already full.

00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:41.939
No, the next part of our date.

00:18:42.379 --> 00:18:46.319
We're going to see a movie. I even booked us a couple's seats.

00:18:46.849 --> 00:18:49.579
Look, I have to get going. I have another meeting.

00:18:50.419 --> 00:18:51.449
What did you say?

00:18:51.919 --> 00:18:53.589
But I thought we were going on a date today.

00:18:54.319 --> 00:18:56.059
Yes, I just asked if you wanted to get lunch.

00:18:56.389 --> 00:18:57.459
You've got to be kidding me.

00:18:58.489 --> 00:19:01.059
What kind of date is just grabbing lunch?

00:19:01.399 --> 00:19:06.129
You should've told me the plan. It's a weekday. I still have work.

00:19:06.669 --> 00:19:07.899
But still...

00:19:09.199 --> 00:19:10.209
Oh, wait.

00:19:11.369 --> 00:19:12.509
(Ji Hyuk's Father)

00:19:14.209 --> 00:19:15.739
(Ji Hyuk's Father)

00:19:25.889 --> 00:19:27.389
Hey, Seong Jae.

00:19:28.089 --> 00:19:31.359
Listen, did something happen with Ji Hyuk?

00:19:32.259 --> 00:19:34.529
The deal with AP didn't work out, did it?

00:19:34.599 --> 00:19:37.429
You knew about the AP acquisition?

00:19:37.569 --> 00:19:40.969
Yes, I heard about it. The rest of the family doesn't know.

00:19:41.439 --> 00:19:43.139
It's just that...

00:19:43.209 --> 00:19:46.479
Ji Hyuk came home yesterday but didn't go to work this morning,

00:19:46.709 --> 00:19:48.579
and he seems to be just lying in his room.

00:19:49.579 --> 00:19:50.609
It fell through, didn't it?

00:19:53.679 --> 00:19:54.679
Yes.

00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:58.719
A key investor pulled out, so the acquisition is unlikely now.

00:19:59.489 --> 00:20:00.789
Everything was going so well.

00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:03.389
He was so close to getting it.

00:20:03.789 --> 00:20:05.459
What? It was that close?

00:20:05.659 --> 00:20:08.329
So please don't be too hard on Ji Hyuk.

00:20:08.399 --> 00:20:12.429
Okay. Don't say anything to him. And one more thing,

00:20:12.599 --> 00:20:14.839
don't you ever mention that I called you.

00:20:15.499 --> 00:20:17.909
All right, then. Bye.

00:20:21.239 --> 00:20:22.639
So they were that close?

00:20:23.749 --> 00:20:25.009
To pulling off a miracle like that?

00:20:31.219 --> 00:20:33.119
His dad is so worried.

00:20:48.899 --> 00:20:51.109
Su Bin, were you crying?

00:20:53.809 --> 00:20:56.109
Why would I be crying? My eyes were just itchy.

00:20:56.649 --> 00:20:59.349
I'll make sure to double-check our plans next time.

00:21:01.049 --> 00:21:02.819
Yes. Do that next time.

00:21:03.819 --> 00:21:06.819
But still, I'm glad I got to see you enjoy the food.

00:21:08.289 --> 00:21:09.859
Let's go. I'll get you a cab.

00:21:10.389 --> 00:21:12.289
No, it's okay. I'll walk with you to your car.

00:21:12.889 --> 00:21:14.399
No, the parking lot is right here.

00:21:14.829 --> 00:21:16.699
Exactly. I'll walk you there.

00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:25.569
Anyway, it's a nice day for a stroll.

00:21:26.339 --> 00:21:28.109
Hey. Let me get that.

00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:30.549
Let's go.

00:21:41.689 --> 00:21:42.689
Here.

00:21:43.659 --> 00:21:45.559
Hey, since you were so stubborn about not taking a cab.

00:21:49.899 --> 00:21:50.929
Get going.

00:21:52.699 --> 00:21:54.469
- You go first. - Lee Su Bin.

00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:56.709
Fine.

00:22:17.529 --> 00:22:19.429
Why is she leaving like that? It's so not her.

00:22:23.869 --> 00:22:25.799
She's making me worry.

00:22:26.769 --> 00:22:28.069
My Yeong Ra?

00:22:29.499 --> 00:22:31.369
Surely not. That can't be right.

00:22:31.769 --> 00:22:33.809
What do you mean she doesn't like Mr. Lee Sang Hoon?

00:22:33.939 --> 00:22:37.979
Oh dear. Sang Hoon is asking if our families are in agreement.

00:22:38.379 --> 00:22:40.649
He says your daughter won't answer his calls,

00:22:40.719 --> 00:22:44.919
and he feels she's avoiding him since she only texts him she's busy.

00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:47.519
My goodness, no. That's not it at all, ma'am.

00:22:48.089 --> 00:22:51.429
It's just when Yeong Ra paints, she gets lost in her work.

00:22:51.859 --> 00:22:53.729
Plus, she's a bit of a homebody,

00:22:53.899 --> 00:22:57.229
so she's not always on her phone like kids these days.

00:22:59.769 --> 00:23:01.669
I'm so sorry for the worry we've caused.

00:23:02.099 --> 00:23:04.209
I'll have a word with her and get back to you.

00:23:05.569 --> 00:23:06.909
Yes. Of course.

00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:12.179
Gosh, what is with this girl?

00:23:12.949 --> 00:23:16.579
I'm on the verge of something huge, and she's making things difficult.

00:23:23.689 --> 00:23:25.129
(Park Yeong Ra's Studio)

00:23:25.229 --> 00:23:27.059
(Yeong Ra's Car, Parking Lot)

00:23:30.629 --> 00:23:33.199
This hits the spot right after some spicy malatang.

00:23:34.069 --> 00:23:35.469
You can't eat malatang...

00:23:35.469 --> 00:23:37.439
just a few hours after having cheese tteokbokki.

00:23:37.509 --> 00:23:38.869
It is super high in calories.

00:23:41.579 --> 00:23:42.579
But...

00:23:42.939 --> 00:23:44.809
I don't really gain weight that easily.

00:23:45.849 --> 00:23:46.849
Besides,

00:23:47.419 --> 00:23:49.849
even if I gain some weight now, my mom won't say a thing.

00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:51.719
I've got Lee Sang Hoon, remember?

00:23:54.089 --> 00:23:55.889
You've got Lee Sang Hoon?

00:23:56.759 --> 00:23:58.289
What's that supposed to mean?

00:23:59.589 --> 00:24:03.129
Never mind. Hey, let's go sing.

00:24:03.469 --> 00:24:04.529
Let's go burn this off.

00:24:04.529 --> 00:24:07.739
No matter what

00:24:10.839 --> 00:24:13.939
My love for you is

00:24:14.039 --> 00:24:17.279
- Unconditional - Unconditional

00:24:17.449 --> 00:24:19.179
- My love - My love

00:24:19.249 --> 00:24:21.119
- Park Yeong Ra, you can sing. - For you

00:24:21.119 --> 00:24:24.149
- You learn that from me? - Is very special

00:24:25.889 --> 00:24:28.989
Across the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean

00:24:29.189 --> 00:24:32.489
- Even if I cross the Indian Ocean - Even if I cross the Indian Ocean

00:24:32.589 --> 00:24:36.199
- Call for me, and I'll come running - Call for me, and I'll come running

00:24:36.329 --> 00:24:39.629
I'll come running, no matter what

00:24:51.379 --> 00:24:54.619
No matter what

(Director Ko)

00:24:58.119 --> 00:25:00.389
- Hey, Park Yeong Ra. - Call me when you need me

00:25:00.389 --> 00:25:03.989
- Stop! - I'll come running anytime

00:25:04.089 --> 00:25:06.729
Park Yeong Ra! Stop!

Ji Wan!

- Ji Wan! - Hey, she's almost there.

00:25:30.719 --> 00:25:31.719
What?

00:26:10.689 --> 00:26:13.389
- Mom. - What do you think you're doing?

00:26:14.899 --> 00:26:19.129
I think I've gained a little weight, so I was just getting some exercise.

00:26:19.999 --> 00:26:22.039
Why are you avoiding VP Lee Sang Hoon's calls?

00:26:22.739 --> 00:26:23.769
What?

00:26:23.769 --> 00:26:26.639
You don't answer his calls and texted him saying you were busy.

00:26:28.879 --> 00:26:29.879
Yes.

00:26:31.079 --> 00:26:32.809
He's intimidating.

00:26:33.449 --> 00:26:35.479
You don't answer his calls because you're intimidated?

00:26:35.749 --> 00:26:37.649
No, that's not what I meant.

00:26:38.319 --> 00:26:41.389
I didn't see that he had called until later,

00:26:41.789 --> 00:26:43.629
and I was too shy to call him back,

00:26:43.989 --> 00:26:46.829
- so I decided to wait for his call. - Then what about the text?

00:26:48.059 --> 00:26:49.859
The thing about the text is...

00:26:50.229 --> 00:26:52.869
He just texted out of the blue asking to meet tomorrow,

00:26:54.039 --> 00:26:56.769
and I just needed a little time to prepare myself.

00:26:56.839 --> 00:26:59.739
You've met him two times already. What is there to prepare for?

00:27:00.539 --> 00:27:03.179
Now, they think you're avoiding him.

00:27:03.409 --> 00:27:06.549
The chairman's wife at Jinhwa Group called me herself.

00:27:07.079 --> 00:27:10.689
Do you want to ruin this marriage? We're talking about Jinhwa Group!

00:27:12.719 --> 00:27:14.359
No, that's not it.

00:27:14.659 --> 00:27:16.689
When Lee Sang Hoon calls, you go meet him. Immediately.

00:27:17.089 --> 00:27:20.459
What's the point of being cooped up in here all day?

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:22.229
Are you trying to be a real artist or something?

00:27:29.439 --> 00:27:30.639
You find painting fun?

00:27:32.239 --> 00:27:33.239
Yes.

00:27:34.939 --> 00:27:37.709
Look at the quality of your paintings.

00:27:38.349 --> 00:27:40.349
Don't you realise you have no talent for painting?

00:27:48.959 --> 00:27:50.559
You're an artist now,

00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:52.459
so stop painting. It's getting you nowhere.

00:27:52.689 --> 00:27:53.799
Instead,

00:27:54.129 --> 00:27:58.499
let's try art appreciation lessons. That's how you'll run a gallery.

00:27:59.099 --> 00:28:01.769
I'll speak to Professor Kim, so get ready.

00:28:02.139 --> 00:28:03.639
Get ready for what?

00:28:04.539 --> 00:28:06.109
To get your mind right.

00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:08.339
And to get married.

00:28:19.819 --> 00:28:22.019
- Thank you. - Thank you. Have a great day.

00:28:23.989 --> 00:28:24.989
Let's go.

00:28:35.699 --> 00:28:37.469
Lying here just like back then.

00:28:42.639 --> 00:28:44.379
Why am I so devastated?

00:28:44.949 --> 00:28:47.719
It's not like acquiring AP Group was the be-all and end-all.

00:28:48.019 --> 00:28:49.819
It was just a project I wanted to take on.

00:28:50.349 --> 00:28:53.119
I think this is fun. I'm doing it because I enjoy it.

00:28:54.959 --> 00:28:56.089
Gosh, what time is it?

00:29:08.299 --> 00:29:09.699
(Ji Eun Oh)

00:29:09.799 --> 00:29:13.879
You took a long shot and missed. Is that a reason to skip work, CEO?

00:29:16.079 --> 00:29:17.809
She always hits the nail on the head.

00:29:18.979 --> 00:29:21.779
Don't tell me you were just hoping to get lucky.

00:29:22.779 --> 00:29:25.449
Then you can just get back on track.

00:29:26.619 --> 00:29:28.159
Let's face reality.

00:29:29.589 --> 00:29:33.029
It seems Lady Luck isn't on your side this time.

00:29:35.099 --> 00:29:38.399
It would've taken a lot of luck to make it happen.

00:29:46.369 --> 00:29:49.339
You can adjust the settings with this.

00:29:53.079 --> 00:29:54.749
It feels nice and warm.

00:29:54.819 --> 00:29:57.749
Just help the customers try it out like this.

00:29:58.649 --> 00:30:01.919
Trying it myself really makes it clear.

00:30:03.319 --> 00:30:07.129
- This product's main feature is... - Da Jeong, you can go home now.

00:30:07.499 --> 00:30:08.759
Okay.

00:30:10.329 --> 00:30:11.899
I can't believe it's so late.

00:30:22.879 --> 00:30:24.709
(Gyeong Hun)

00:30:24.779 --> 00:30:28.279
(Hey, Gyeong Hun...)

00:30:32.089 --> 00:30:34.759
No. I should just call him.

00:30:40.229 --> 00:30:42.159
- Hey, Sang Cheol! - Hey, Yeong Bo.

00:30:42.229 --> 00:30:43.529
Why are you heading home at this hour?

00:30:43.729 --> 00:30:46.599
Shouldn't you be out making deliveries on the bike now?

00:30:46.869 --> 00:30:51.169
Yes, I did something else today. The delivery gig doesn't pay well,

00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:53.069
so I'll do better-paying day labour for a while.

00:30:53.239 --> 00:30:56.809
Why? Is something wrong? Is it about your father-in-law?

00:30:57.079 --> 00:30:59.579
Why bring up my father-in-law out of the blue?

00:30:59.949 --> 00:31:01.649
No, that's not it. It's just...

00:31:02.049 --> 00:31:05.619
The practical test is in a few days, and if you pass,

00:31:05.749 --> 00:31:08.389
you're going to start looking for an electrician job, right?

00:31:08.989 --> 00:31:11.129
Yes, I'm just feeling a little anxious.

00:31:11.529 --> 00:31:15.929
This might not be the time to relax and just earn enough to get by.

00:31:16.359 --> 00:31:19.569
- I have to go. - Hey, stay for a drink. It's on me.

00:31:19.629 --> 00:31:21.069
You said nothing was wrong at home.

00:31:21.139 --> 00:31:25.069
I can't drink or goof off. Take it easy.

00:31:27.579 --> 00:31:29.209
Something's definitely up with Lee Sang Cheol.

00:31:32.049 --> 00:31:33.149
I'm home.

00:31:33.879 --> 00:31:35.219
You're home early today.

00:31:36.649 --> 00:31:38.089
Is everything okay at home?

00:31:39.419 --> 00:31:41.389
Why would anything be wrong?

00:31:42.019 --> 00:31:43.989
Let me just finish this, and I'll get dinner ready.

00:31:44.429 --> 00:31:45.789
Okay, thanks.

00:31:57.099 --> 00:32:00.509
Honey, Ji Hyuk's door is locked. Can you get it open?

00:32:04.579 --> 00:32:07.049
Ji Hyuk's in there. Just go downstairs. Go on.

00:32:07.219 --> 00:32:09.549
Why would Ji Hyuk be here at this hour?

00:32:10.119 --> 00:32:12.149
I thought he didn't come home last night.

00:32:12.419 --> 00:32:14.589
Look, just go downstairs first. We can talk downstairs.

00:32:14.659 --> 00:32:15.989
- Come on, let's go. - What? Why?

00:32:16.059 --> 00:32:18.289
- Downstairs, come on. - What is going on?

00:32:25.099 --> 00:32:29.369
You're saying he's been holed up in his room since last night?

00:32:29.569 --> 00:32:32.139
- Did his business fail? - Hey, watch it.

00:32:32.969 --> 00:32:37.179
If he snuck in quietly last night, something's seriously wrong with it.

00:32:37.309 --> 00:32:39.909
So what if there is a problem, and so what if there isn't?

00:32:40.579 --> 00:32:43.279
Gosh, will you just tell Ji Hyuk to come down?

00:32:43.349 --> 00:32:45.319
Mother, just pretend you don't know anything.

00:32:45.589 --> 00:32:48.559
Business has its ups and downs.

00:32:48.619 --> 00:32:51.559
Why tell the family every little thing?

00:32:51.559 --> 00:32:53.029
- Oh, dear. - You too. Just ignore him.

00:32:53.129 --> 00:32:54.129
Ji Wan, you too.

00:32:56.429 --> 00:32:59.929
Try to stay out of his way today, if you can.

00:33:00.569 --> 00:33:02.539
- Mother, just go to your room. - All right, I'm going.

00:33:02.869 --> 00:33:06.569
So that means Ji Hyuk hasn't eaten anything all day.

00:33:06.639 --> 00:33:09.439
He'll come down and eat on his own if he's hungry.

00:33:11.109 --> 00:33:12.109
Dad.

00:33:26.689 --> 00:33:27.799
Man, I'm starving.

00:33:28.359 --> 00:33:29.529
What? What's this?

00:33:30.599 --> 00:33:31.899
Oh, it's hotteok.

00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:50.689
You...

00:33:51.049 --> 00:33:53.249
The AP acquisition fell through, didn't it?

00:33:54.359 --> 00:33:56.089
You already know the answer, so why ask?

00:33:56.659 --> 00:33:58.159
Are you trying to rub it in?

00:33:58.889 --> 00:34:03.299
You expected to take over AP Group with a mindset this fragile?

00:34:03.929 --> 00:34:05.099
That's why you failed.

00:34:05.999 --> 00:34:07.299
It went just the way you wanted, Dad.

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:09.399
You knew I was going to fail.

00:34:09.769 --> 00:34:12.269
That's right. I knew you would.

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:14.609
So, are you satisfied?

00:34:15.339 --> 00:34:16.839
Why would I be satisfied?

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:19.779
When my own son is acting like a complete loser?

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:22.479
Acting like a loser? What are you talking about?

00:34:22.919 --> 00:34:25.819
You failed at 1 thing and spent the last 2 days moping in bed.

00:34:26.689 --> 00:34:29.159
I checked, and the bid deadline is not over.

00:34:29.689 --> 00:34:31.659
What does the deadline matter?

00:34:31.959 --> 00:34:33.489
I couldn't secure the funds for the acquisition.

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:35.699
What would you do if you were in my shoes, Dad?

00:34:36.259 --> 00:34:38.299
If it were me, I'd go see the chairman himself.

00:34:38.799 --> 00:34:39.799
What?

00:34:40.129 --> 00:34:42.139
You have to crawl over that mountain if that's what it takes.

00:34:42.439 --> 00:34:43.699
That's the only way to have no regrets.

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:50.009
Dad, you don't understand business, but it all comes down to money.

00:34:51.509 --> 00:34:54.779
There are two other companies with their full funds ready.

00:34:54.919 --> 00:34:56.019
And there could be more for all I know.

00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:58.619
So what? Were you completely confident at first?

00:34:59.219 --> 00:35:02.989
A major investor pulled out. I don't even have half the funds.

00:35:03.089 --> 00:35:04.529
How am I supposed to win the bidding war?

00:35:05.389 --> 00:35:07.129
You don't know what you're talking about.

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:11.699
In a bidding war, it's still people who control the money.

00:35:12.799 --> 00:35:14.469
Money doesn't make decisions by itself.

00:35:15.199 --> 00:35:19.369
The meaning of that money changes depending on the person holding it.

00:35:19.809 --> 00:35:20.809
See?

00:35:21.909 --> 00:35:23.909
What have you got to lose?

00:35:24.609 --> 00:35:26.149
For someone who acts like such a know-it-all.

00:35:26.879 --> 00:35:28.879
You can't live with regrets, can you?

00:35:29.619 --> 00:35:33.189
You went all the way to the altar. So you have no regrets, right?

00:35:33.319 --> 00:35:36.859
If you hadn't, you'd spend your life wondering what if and being bitter.

00:35:37.429 --> 00:35:40.429
Gosh. What does that have to do with anything?

00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:43.459
I bought that hotteok.

00:35:45.569 --> 00:35:47.739
Fine, how much were they? What? How much do I owe you?

00:35:48.199 --> 00:35:49.199
Four dollars for two.

00:35:51.869 --> 00:35:56.309
You won't go. Not everyone has that much courage.

00:36:01.819 --> 00:36:02.879
Go and see him?

00:36:04.019 --> 00:36:05.849
Meet the chairman?

00:36:06.789 --> 00:36:07.819
That's ridiculous.

00:36:11.759 --> 00:36:12.789
But wait, why not?

00:36:14.199 --> 00:36:15.599
Why didn't I think of that?

Why does this feel so familiar?

00:36:35.549 --> 00:36:36.549
I've heard this before...

00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:47.799
My grandmother passed away the following year.

00:36:48.099 --> 00:36:49.199
From then on, I was really...

00:36:49.799 --> 00:36:53.369
bounced around between all sorts of relatives' houses.

00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:56.169
There was an orphanage in my neighbourhood back then,

00:36:56.769 --> 00:36:59.139
and I was so jealous of the kids who lived there.

00:36:59.569 --> 00:37:03.139
I wanted to sleep somewhere warm and eat my meals on time.

00:37:04.809 --> 00:37:06.249
I had fun...

00:37:06.879 --> 00:37:08.179
growing the company.

00:37:08.579 --> 00:37:11.049
Of course, I wanted to make money too.

00:37:11.419 --> 00:37:14.049
But I realised something while doing all this work.

00:37:14.719 --> 00:37:16.889
Money doesn't come to you just because you chase it.

00:37:17.359 --> 00:37:19.129
That's why you have to have fun.

00:37:19.459 --> 00:37:23.229
If it's fun, you can pour yourself into it without getting worn out,

00:37:23.599 --> 00:37:26.029
and then the results will follow naturally.

00:37:26.469 --> 00:37:28.999
Money doesn't come to you just because you chase it?

00:37:29.369 --> 00:37:30.369

00:37:31.209 --> 00:37:32.209
Does that even make sense?

He's something else, isn't he?

00:37:35.239 --> 00:37:37.649
Mr. Park. You've met him?

00:37:38.249 --> 00:37:39.249
I sure have.

00:37:42.249 --> 00:37:46.019

Yes, this is Edel Orphanage.

00:37:58.699 --> 00:38:01.939
Hi, I'm sorry to call so late. Back in 2016,

00:38:02.269 --> 00:38:04.809
I helped with the Edel Orphanage renovation.

00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:08.079
You sound much brighter, Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:38:09.739 --> 00:38:11.649
I saw you here when you came to help out in the spring.

00:38:12.549 --> 00:38:15.419
You used to call me Mr. Park during the renovation.

00:38:15.779 --> 00:38:19.289
- I guess you didn't recognise me. - Oh, I'm sorry.

00:38:20.089 --> 00:38:23.289
I guess I was so out of it back then that I didn't remember.

00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:25.659
It's okay.

00:38:26.229 --> 00:38:27.329
So, what can I do for you?

00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:31.869
Yes, during the renovation, I saw a local Cheongpo magazine.

00:38:32.529 --> 00:38:36.069
It interviewed Kim Dong Su, the man who built Edel Orphanage,

00:38:37.039 --> 00:38:38.839
and I was just wondering if it might still be in the library.

00:38:39.369 --> 00:38:40.909
Of course. We still have it.

00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:43.309
It's about our orphanage's founder, after all.

00:38:43.879 --> 00:38:47.579
Can you snap the interview page and send it?

00:38:47.979 --> 00:38:49.379
I'm in a bit of a situation.

00:38:58.859 --> 00:39:00.899
Why do I keep feeling so guilty?

00:39:03.559 --> 00:39:07.229
No. It was unavoidable.

She keeps saying she's nervous.

Why be nervous, Mom? You've made this for decades.

Don't worry about the taste.

00:51:30.839 --> 00:51:33.309
His company has nowhere near enough capital for the acquisition.

00:51:33.379 --> 00:51:36.779
But how did he know to dig up such an old connection?

00:51:53.799 --> 00:51:58.199
Why are you just staring at me without saying anything?

00:52:02.039 --> 00:52:05.379
Why do I still miss you even when you're right here?

00:52:08.009 --> 00:52:10.379
I guess I just can't get enough of looking at you.

00:52:13.949 --> 00:52:16.189
You'd only known me as an interior designer,

00:52:16.619 --> 00:52:18.459
so I imagine this is hard for you to accept.

00:52:19.489 --> 00:52:20.529
For me, too.

00:52:21.529 --> 00:52:23.529
I still just see you as the director.

00:52:28.099 --> 00:52:29.339
Not for me.

00:52:31.299 --> 00:52:35.209
So you still just see me as the director.

00:52:37.479 --> 00:52:40.479
It just doesn't feel real yet.

00:52:43.949 --> 00:52:44.949
Of course.

00:52:45.789 --> 00:52:47.689
We only just found out yesterday, after all.

00:52:50.619 --> 00:52:52.559
I suppose it's different for a mother and her child.

00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:54.889
For me,

00:52:56.429 --> 00:52:59.429
you already feel so much like my daughter.

00:53:01.599 --> 00:53:02.699
I'm sorry.

00:53:10.879 --> 00:53:12.149
Could you call me Mom...

00:53:13.949 --> 00:53:16.649
just once?

00:53:24.689 --> 00:53:26.589
I'll have to think about that.

00:53:29.529 --> 00:53:30.599
To be honest...

00:53:31.459 --> 00:53:36.269
I thought my birth parents had lost me and were in agony,

00:53:36.339 --> 00:53:38.069
so I went ahead with the DNA Registration.

00:53:38.509 --> 00:53:41.779
I never actually thought I would find you.

00:53:43.509 --> 00:53:44.539
So...

00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:47.879
I never thought about what to do...

00:53:48.819 --> 00:53:50.749
after we actually met.

00:53:52.649 --> 00:53:55.659
My gosh, I see.

00:53:56.819 --> 00:54:00.359
I'm so sorry. I didn't consider your feelings.

00:54:01.799 --> 00:54:05.369
You need time, of course. I'm sorry.

00:54:06.729 --> 00:54:07.829
No, it's okay.

00:54:17.609 --> 00:54:18.809
You said she truly...

00:54:19.449 --> 00:54:22.449
raised you with so much love.

00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:27.989
I'd like to thank your mother first, before anything else.

00:54:28.389 --> 00:54:30.919
- It's the right thing to do. - No, you can't do that.

00:54:32.829 --> 00:54:34.029
Gosh, I'm sorry.

00:54:34.529 --> 00:54:36.129
That was thoughtless of me.

00:54:37.599 --> 00:54:40.429
You haven't told your mother yet, have you?

00:54:41.969 --> 00:54:44.499
No. Not yet.

00:54:48.169 --> 00:54:49.179
But...

00:54:50.379 --> 00:54:54.149
you mentioned that my birth father died in a hit-and-run.

00:54:56.949 --> 00:54:58.719
What was he like?

00:55:04.589 --> 00:55:05.859
We really do have...

00:55:07.229 --> 00:55:09.299
so much to catch up on...

00:55:10.029 --> 00:55:11.699
for all the years we've lost.

00:55:14.199 --> 00:55:16.769
Losing my daughter tore my heart to pieces,

00:55:19.509 --> 00:55:22.479
and now my son's suffering is ripping me apart.

00:55:25.949 --> 00:55:28.779
You also mentioned that your son was sick.

00:55:30.079 --> 00:55:31.719
What's wrong with him?

00:55:33.089 --> 00:55:35.419
Did I say that my Jin was sick?

00:55:36.859 --> 00:55:39.489
Yes. You just said he was sick...

00:55:41.729 --> 00:55:42.829
I see.

00:55:47.969 --> 00:55:49.639
His liver has been in very bad shape.

00:55:51.739 --> 00:55:54.109
He needed a liver transplant,

00:55:55.979 --> 00:55:58.679
but thankfully, we found a donor and scheduled the surgery.

00:56:03.579 --> 00:56:05.489
So it's really serious, then.

00:56:10.389 --> 00:56:14.389
Do you remember your brother at all from when you were a kid?

00:56:18.899 --> 00:56:19.899
No.

00:56:20.899 --> 00:56:22.169
That's a huge relief.

00:56:27.239 --> 00:56:30.309
(Ms. Shin)

00:56:30.379 --> 00:56:31.539
Call me now.

00:56:36.379 --> 00:56:39.049
So, when is the surgery?

00:56:39.649 --> 00:56:41.289
Well, it's...

00:56:44.659 --> 00:56:45.959
It's the hospital. Just a moment.

00:56:47.989 --> 00:56:49.059
Yes, Doctor.

00:56:53.029 --> 00:56:54.569
What do you mean?

00:56:55.169 --> 00:56:56.369
What do you mean, it's cancelled?

00:56:59.309 --> 00:57:02.579
That's ridiculous, Doctor. How can this be happening?

00:57:05.239 --> 00:57:07.049
Yes, I understand. I'm on my way.

00:57:09.849 --> 00:57:11.919
Eun Oh, I am so sorry.

00:57:12.219 --> 00:57:15.819
The donor... They said he suddenly backed out.

00:57:16.689 --> 00:57:19.589
Let's talk on the way.

00:57:20.489 --> 00:57:22.799
No, it's okay. You should get to the hospital.

00:57:23.129 --> 00:57:25.329
No, I can't just leave you like this.

00:57:26.299 --> 00:57:28.669
Your place is on the way. I'll drop you off.

00:57:32.139 --> 00:57:33.409
(Who's the author? I hope the next one comes soon.)

00:57:33.469 --> 00:57:34.739
(Dokgo Chan's name is hilarious, but he's so cool.)

00:57:44.419 --> 00:57:45.419
Park Yeong Ra.

00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:49.459
- What? - Stop staring at it. Let's go home.

00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:51.019
Hey, it's already 6pm.

00:57:51.119 --> 00:57:54.289
Hey, over 10,000 people have read my webtoon.

00:57:54.659 --> 00:57:56.529
You've told me that three times already.

00:57:58.229 --> 00:58:01.899
Everyone's saying it's amazing. They're wondering who the author is.

00:58:02.469 --> 00:58:06.109
They're asking for the next episode, and they love Dokgo Chan.

00:58:07.139 --> 00:58:08.709
They're asking if So Ri is going to die...

00:58:08.979 --> 00:58:10.879
and if it has a sad ending.

00:58:11.739 --> 00:58:14.179
Reading the comments is so surreal and exciting.

00:58:14.349 --> 00:58:16.579
You'll never read them all even if you stay up all night.

00:58:16.579 --> 00:58:17.979
They'll just keep coming.

00:58:18.149 --> 00:58:19.949
So just read them tomorrow when you're back here.

00:58:20.049 --> 00:58:21.589
Just a little bit longer.

00:58:23.559 --> 00:58:26.189
You'd better stop before your mom gets suspicious.

00:58:30.299 --> 00:58:32.399
It's always my mom.

00:58:32.829 --> 00:58:33.929
Come on, get up.

00:58:38.439 --> 00:58:40.609
How can this happen? How could the donor disappear...

00:58:40.669 --> 00:58:43.039
when the surgery is less than ten days away?

00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:49.449
So what are we supposed to do now? There aren't any other donors.

00:58:52.589 --> 00:58:53.889
I'm on my way now.

00:58:54.519 --> 00:58:56.289
Yes, of course. I'll drive carefully.

00:59:04.699 --> 00:59:06.969
Is the situation that bad?

00:59:11.869 --> 00:59:15.239
It's been bad for a while now.

00:59:17.639 --> 00:59:19.409
I'm sorry for worrying you.

00:59:39.899 --> 00:59:41.399
You can drop me off here.

00:59:44.239 --> 00:59:46.109
Please drive safely.

00:59:52.779 --> 00:59:53.979
Why are you getting out?

00:59:56.049 --> 00:59:57.419
You're my daughter.

00:59:57.949 --> 00:59:59.819
I can't just drop you off like a passenger.

01:00:05.529 --> 01:00:06.559
And...

01:00:09.329 --> 01:00:11.059
I can call you, right?

01:00:14.129 --> 01:00:15.129
Of course.

01:00:16.569 --> 01:00:17.769
You should get going.

01:00:37.259 --> 01:00:38.319
Eun Oh.

01:00:40.629 --> 01:00:43.529
- Oh, Mom. - Who was that stylish woman?

01:00:45.129 --> 01:00:46.269
A client.

01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:50.339
The one who got you that health screening?

01:00:51.439 --> 01:00:52.439
Yes.

01:00:53.939 --> 01:00:55.709
We had a meeting today,

01:00:56.379 --> 01:00:58.409
and she dropped me off since it was on her way.

01:00:58.839 --> 01:01:00.449
Did you go grocery shopping?

01:01:00.849 --> 01:01:03.579
What? Yes, I stopped by the restaurant.

01:01:04.119 --> 01:01:06.119
The galbi has aged perfectly.

01:01:08.049 --> 01:01:09.219
Of course, it has.

01:01:11.119 --> 01:01:13.089
But you're home from work early today.

01:01:13.729 --> 01:01:14.729
Yes.

01:01:15.529 --> 01:01:17.499
Hey, about that lady...

01:01:17.729 --> 01:01:20.929
When will you actually start construction for her?

01:01:21.429 --> 01:01:24.339
You got 30,000 dollars as your design fee months ago.

01:01:26.009 --> 01:01:27.009
Well...

01:01:27.869 --> 01:01:30.679
There were some leaking issues, and some other things came up.

01:01:31.639 --> 01:01:32.649
Come on, let's go inside.

01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:35.979
She paid you months ago.

01:01:36.379 --> 01:01:38.279
I guess rich people are never in a hurry.

01:01:38.649 --> 01:01:39.689
Hey, wait up.

01:01:50.129 --> 01:01:53.269
Eun Oh, go and get washed up. Gang Oh will be home soon.

01:01:53.899 --> 01:01:55.399
- Should I? - Yes.

01:01:55.499 --> 01:01:57.469
- I'll wash up quickly, then. - Okay.

01:02:02.879 --> 01:02:04.879
(Glass noodles)

01:02:14.189 --> 01:02:15.319
Yes, this is Lee Ji Hyuk.

01:02:15.689 --> 01:02:19.489
- The chairman's ready. Come on up. - Okay.

01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:39.009
(Director Ko Seong Hui)

01:02:40.779 --> 01:02:42.519
(I'm sorry about earlier, for asking you to call me Mom.)

01:02:43.519 --> 01:02:44.649
What is this all about?

01:02:50.159 --> 01:02:52.589
I'm sorry about earlier, for asking you to call me Mom.

01:02:53.959 --> 01:02:55.059
Call her Mom?

01:02:55.859 --> 01:02:57.629
Call me that when it feels right to you.

01:02:57.929 --> 01:03:00.299
I just want to hear it once before I die.

01:03:00.599 --> 01:03:01.669
My daughter.

01:03:02.299 --> 01:03:03.369
"My daughter?"

01:03:11.439 --> 01:03:12.609
Wait. Then...

01:03:13.449 --> 01:03:15.979
That woman was...

01:03:48.009 --> 01:03:50.349
(Our Golden Days)

01:03:50.519 --> 01:03:52.949
What are you talking about? You did this without talking to me?

01:03:53.019 --> 01:03:55.089
You were going to send your father to your brother?

01:03:55.149 --> 01:03:57.719
Business is about money. This is no place for emotions.

01:03:57.819 --> 01:03:59.759
That's why he's still an amateur.

01:03:59.859 --> 01:04:03.429
This is so lame. I need a chance to at least look at her...

01:04:03.499 --> 01:04:05.159
to see if I could ever see her as more than a friend.

01:04:05.229 --> 01:04:08.429
Mom is lying. What if she's having an affair?

01:04:08.529 --> 01:04:09.739
I need to get to the bottom of this.

01:04:09.939 --> 01:04:13.809
They need a compatibility test. Eun Oh, would you consider...

01:04:13.939 --> 01:04:18.239
- No, never mind, Eun Oh. - I'll get tested.
