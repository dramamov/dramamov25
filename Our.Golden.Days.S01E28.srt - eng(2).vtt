00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:03.302
(Episode 28)

00:00:04.742 --> 00:00:06.372
(Director Ko Seong Hui)

00:00:08.172 --> 00:00:09.682
(I'm sorry about earlier, for asking you to call me Mom.)

00:00:10.912 --> 00:00:12.082
What's going on?

00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:19.892
I'm sorry about earlier, for asking you to call me Mom.

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:22.422
Call her Mom?

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:25.161
Call me that when it feels right to you.

00:00:25.162 --> 00:00:27.532
I just want to hear it once before I die.

00:00:27.892 --> 00:00:29.002
My daughter.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:30.662
"My daughter?"

00:00:38.912 --> 00:00:39.912
Wait. Then...

00:00:40.872 --> 00:00:43.212
That woman was...

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.072
My Eun Oh...

00:01:10.872 --> 00:01:12.242
met her birth mother?

00:01:13.512 --> 00:01:15.942
When? How?

00:01:18.782 --> 00:01:19.882
A client.

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:26.252
Mom, I got a construction project worth 200,000 dollars today.

00:01:27.652 --> 00:01:29.492
Don't tell me they've been meeting ever since then.

00:01:30.892 --> 00:01:33.262
So Eun Oh wanted to find her birth mother.

00:01:34.462 --> 00:01:36.332
How long has she felt that way?

00:01:37.262 --> 00:01:38.802
Was it since what happened with Gang Oh?

00:01:40.902 --> 00:01:42.572
What am I going to do?

00:01:55.252 --> 00:01:56.322
Mom.

00:02:00.592 --> 00:02:01.592
Mom?

00:02:10.762 --> 00:02:12.302
(Mom)

00:02:24.882 --> 00:02:26.812
What's this? She left her phone.

00:02:31.922 --> 00:02:32.922
Mom.

00:02:37.062 --> 00:02:38.092
That's strange.

00:02:38.622 --> 00:02:39.732
Where could she have gone?

00:03:21.532 --> 00:03:23.802
He needed a liver transplant,

00:03:24.672 --> 00:03:27.312
but thankfully, we found a donor and scheduled the surgery.

00:03:28.572 --> 00:03:32.852
So what are we supposed to do now? There aren't any other donors.

00:03:34.312 --> 00:03:36.652
Does that mean he could die?

00:03:39.992 --> 00:03:41.722
- Hey! - You scared me.

00:03:42.562 --> 00:03:45.392
Where's Mom? Why are you praying over the stew?

00:03:46.232 --> 00:03:47.692
Hasn't Mom come back from the restaurant yet?

00:03:48.262 --> 00:03:49.562
She is back.

00:03:49.902 --> 00:03:52.332
But I think she just stepped out for a bit.

00:03:52.602 --> 00:03:54.172
She even left her phone.

00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:01.472
Mom.

00:04:02.312 --> 00:04:03.782
- Where have you been? - Oh, hey.

00:04:04.312 --> 00:04:07.312
Well, I was making stew and realised we were out of tofu.

00:04:07.382 --> 00:04:12.082
I rushed to the market for some, but I forgot my wallet.

00:04:12.152 --> 00:04:16.362
So, I guess we're having the stew without tofu today.

00:04:16.662 --> 00:04:18.262
How could you forget the tofu?

00:04:18.722 --> 00:04:20.732
- I know, right? - What?

00:04:21.292 --> 00:04:22.632
But the tofu's right there.

00:04:26.072 --> 00:04:27.172
So it is.

00:04:27.732 --> 00:04:29.572
Gosh, how did I not see it when I looked before?

00:04:30.802 --> 00:04:34.512
Mom, how many fingers do you see? Tell me, how many?

00:04:35.812 --> 00:04:36.942
Get out of the way.

00:04:44.982 --> 00:04:47.792
I've secured the capital for 52 percent of the shares.

00:04:48.052 --> 00:04:49.791
As for the remaining shares, I'll acquire 15 percent in year 1,

00:04:49.792 --> 00:04:51.092
then 25 percent in year 2,

00:04:51.322 --> 00:04:52.732
and the final 10 percent in year 3.

00:04:53.032 --> 00:04:55.032
I propose a phased acquisition.

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:58.732
You'll oversee my progress as an advisor for three years.

00:04:58.902 --> 00:05:00.972
If I fail to deliver on this promise in three years,

00:05:01.402 --> 00:05:02.842
I will return the company to you.

00:05:02.942 --> 00:05:06.442
You want me to give up my company for only half the sale price?

00:05:06.512 --> 00:05:09.982
In return, you won't watch AP Group, the company you built, go under.

00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:12.612
Rumiko intends to absorb and gut AP Group.

00:05:12.682 --> 00:05:15.552
And for Yeongsin Paper, who knows how they'll corrupt its identity?

00:05:15.612 --> 00:05:18.222
I'm sure you're well aware of this, sir.

00:05:18.282 --> 00:05:22.692
What's the guarantee you'll preserve the company's integrity?

00:05:22.962 --> 00:05:25.492
Because you didn't get into business just for the money.

00:05:25.862 --> 00:05:27.292
It has to be fun for it not to feel tiring.

00:05:27.562 --> 00:05:28.862
Only then can you dig in persistently.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:32.672
And that's how you get results. I saw you say that in an interview.

00:05:34.502 --> 00:05:39.242
- The interview about the orphanage? - That's what we have in common.

00:05:39.542 --> 00:05:41.912
Because I also find joy in running and growing my company.

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:46.151
I hear you've grown your company well.

00:05:46.152 --> 00:05:47.952
Still, don't you think...

00:05:48.012 --> 00:05:49.552
you're biting off more than you can chew?

00:05:49.622 --> 00:05:51.222
Because I couldn't bear to miss this opportunity.

00:05:51.882 --> 00:05:54.292
AP Group is the path I want to take anyway.

00:05:54.622 --> 00:05:58.622
I started late and had to be faster. But the fast pace made it exciting.

00:06:00.892 --> 00:06:03.962
Why did you discover your passion so late in life?

00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:15.412
Oh, did that punk really go see him?

00:06:18.812 --> 00:06:22.082
He certainly seemed determined enough.

00:06:25.052 --> 00:06:27.752
Yes. I came back from Cheongpo with this idea...

00:06:28.052 --> 00:06:31.422
for a DIY Interior Design Matching App,

00:06:31.692 --> 00:06:34.832
and that's when I found the work I was meant to do. And I loved it.

00:06:36.332 --> 00:06:38.132
Ditching your own wedding.

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:41.102
You made quite the mess.

00:06:41.832 --> 00:06:46.042
- It's a choice I wouldn't make now. - And that's all?

00:06:46.742 --> 00:06:48.142
Are you done?

00:06:48.672 --> 00:06:51.782
Yes. I believe I've said all I need to.

00:06:53.982 --> 00:06:56.882
You've been watching too many soap operas.

00:06:57.382 --> 00:06:58.382
Excuse me?

00:06:58.452 --> 00:07:02.592
"An orphan who builds an orphanage, not wanting his kids to inherit..."

00:07:02.662 --> 00:07:05.692
And you come to me believing that from a 30-year-old interview?

00:07:06.132 --> 00:07:10.102
I built this company for 30 years. You think I'm not a ruthless beast?

00:07:12.132 --> 00:07:16.202
How could you expect to find the naive, passionate man I was?

00:07:16.842 --> 00:07:20.542
You waltz in with a magazine scrap you read when you were 26...

00:07:20.612 --> 00:07:24.612
and shove it in my face? Did you think I was some pushover?

00:07:24.742 --> 00:07:26.612
- Mr. Chairman, I... - Business is about money.

00:07:27.012 --> 00:07:30.682
Give up 48 percent and wait 3 years? Would you do that in my shoes?

00:07:31.422 --> 00:07:33.152
Cut the emotional appeal.

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:36.822
I see.

00:07:38.522 --> 00:07:39.732
So, you've changed.

00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:42.061
I believed that once a person's values are set,

00:07:42.062 --> 00:07:43.762
they stick to them for life.

00:07:45.872 --> 00:07:46.872
And that just proves...

00:07:48.932 --> 00:07:51.072
- you're naive. - No.

00:07:51.772 --> 00:07:53.642
Why don't you just admit that you're the one who's changed?

00:07:55.112 --> 00:07:57.642
Good luck selling AP Group.

00:07:57.942 --> 00:08:01.982
In ten years, you'll see a company a lot like AP. When you do,

00:08:02.582 --> 00:08:04.252
take a look at the CEO's name.

00:08:11.022 --> 00:08:12.392
He's completely changed.

00:08:13.662 --> 00:08:16.262
Whatever. The whole AP Group makes me sick.

00:08:17.162 --> 00:08:20.572
Gosh, what a waste of energy. I can't believe I listened to Dad.

00:08:20.672 --> 00:08:21.772
Darn it!

00:08:25.002 --> 00:08:29.112
I advised my disrespectful son, whether he took it or not.

00:08:29.782 --> 00:08:31.512
I can't be the one to lose face.

00:08:32.342 --> 00:08:35.512
If I fail the practical exam, he'll look down on me even more.

00:08:39.622 --> 00:08:40.922
Is that Ji Hyuk?

00:08:43.362 --> 00:08:44.662
I'm home.

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:48.092
- Ji Hyuk. - Oh, you're back?

00:08:48.192 --> 00:08:49.202
Ji Hyuk...

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:53.172
Hey, it's no big deal. It's not like the company failed.

00:08:53.302 --> 00:08:54.502
I just crashed.

00:08:55.232 --> 00:08:58.802
But you didn't go to work and slept for two days straight.

00:08:58.902 --> 00:09:00.542
Of course, we were worried.

00:09:00.672 --> 00:09:04.282
Ji Hyuk, are you sure nothing's wrong at the company?

00:09:04.882 --> 00:09:07.382
Ji Hyuk, if something's wrong, you have to tell us.

00:09:07.752 --> 00:09:10.052
It's awful for us when we're kept in the dark.

00:09:10.322 --> 00:09:14.792
Guys, I'm telling you, it's nothing. I ran on fumes and crashed.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:18.022
I was trying to catch up on sleep without anyone knowing,

00:09:18.292 --> 00:09:19.662
but Dad had to make a fuss.

00:09:20.462 --> 00:09:22.562
You're sure nothing's wrong?

00:09:23.002 --> 00:09:24.762
Mom, look at my face.

00:09:25.032 --> 00:09:27.232
You're like a mind reader, Mom. You always know what I'm thinking.

00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:31.042
All right, he's fine.

00:09:34.542 --> 00:09:38.012
Next time, I'll just say that I'm so tired...

00:09:38.542 --> 00:09:39.552
I'm going to sleep for two days.

00:09:40.252 --> 00:09:41.412
I'm going to head upstairs.

00:09:48.452 --> 00:09:50.622
Gosh, that was so embarrassing.

00:09:53.332 --> 00:09:54.462
No, it's fine.

00:09:55.032 --> 00:09:57.302
I did everything I could. That's all that matters.

00:10:00.732 --> 00:10:02.842
So you didn't even have the guts to go, did you?

00:10:03.542 --> 00:10:06.312
You're jumping to conclusions again. I actually went.

00:10:07.942 --> 00:10:09.042
You went to meet him?

00:10:09.582 --> 00:10:11.742
I'm just coming back from my meeting with the chairman.

00:10:12.042 --> 00:10:13.152
And?

00:10:13.582 --> 00:10:15.912
What do you mean, "And?" I got completely shot down.

00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:19.592
I listened to you, and all I got was humiliation.

00:10:20.692 --> 00:10:24.262
It was a long shot anyway.

00:10:24.462 --> 00:10:27.662
You saw it through to the very end. That's what's important.

00:10:28.632 --> 00:10:31.232
Right. Of course, you've never run a business,

00:10:31.562 --> 00:10:33.032
so it's easy for you to talk.

00:10:33.932 --> 00:10:38.441
Hey! Do you have to taste something to know it's rotten?

00:10:38.442 --> 00:10:39.971
What? I may not have run a business myself,

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:42.412
but I know enough business owners to know what's what.

00:10:44.342 --> 00:10:45.342
Fine.

00:10:46.482 --> 00:10:48.782
But I bet it felt good to get it off your chest, right?

00:10:51.382 --> 00:10:52.482
I guess so.

00:10:54.022 --> 00:10:55.592
Then that's all that matters. Good.

00:10:55.692 --> 00:10:57.922
What do you mean "all that matters?" I'm not okay with this.

00:10:58.222 --> 00:11:01.562
Then just try again. Honestly, this kid.

00:11:06.002 --> 00:11:07.072
Come on, Ji Hyuk.

00:11:07.472 --> 00:11:09.172
What do you mean you're not okay with it?

00:11:11.502 --> 00:11:12.712
It's all over now.

00:11:17.742 --> 00:11:20.852
Darn it. I shouldn't have told him that.

00:11:21.812 --> 00:11:24.482
Why did he have to listen to me this one time?

00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:27.492
Of all the things to listen to...

00:11:27.852 --> 00:11:30.092
I just made him look like a fool for nothing.

00:11:37.962 --> 00:11:40.332
What do you mean "all that matters?" I'm not okay with this.

00:11:45.142 --> 00:11:46.172
Ji Hyuk.

00:11:48.012 --> 00:11:49.612
What is it that you're not okay with?

00:11:57.182 --> 00:11:58.182
Right.

00:11:58.682 --> 00:12:00.452
As of today, Seong Jae is the new Vice President.

00:12:01.892 --> 00:12:03.962
- My goodness. Really? - Yes.

00:12:04.162 --> 00:12:05.892
Seong Jae, congratulations.

00:12:06.532 --> 00:12:07.692
Congratulations!

00:12:09.432 --> 00:12:12.002
Thank you. Thanks.

00:12:12.772 --> 00:12:15.802
Wow, you really surprised me, honey.

00:12:16.072 --> 00:12:20.212
You should've given me a heads-up. I would've prepared a party.

00:12:20.872 --> 00:12:24.542
Why make a fuss? It's just the next natural step.

00:12:27.312 --> 00:12:29.152
"The next natural step?"

00:12:30.052 --> 00:12:31.052
Oh, right.

00:12:31.622 --> 00:12:33.252
What's your schedule like today?

00:12:34.792 --> 00:12:37.322
How about the four of us grab lunch to celebrate?

00:12:37.622 --> 00:12:39.562
See? There you go again.

00:12:40.232 --> 00:12:43.302
The Magnolia Society meeting is today.

00:12:43.832 --> 00:12:45.162
Today's not great for me either.

00:12:45.632 --> 00:12:48.932
- Let's do it after the launch. - Right. I forgot about that.

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:51.202
Okay, let's do that.

00:12:52.402 --> 00:12:53.442
What a relief.

00:12:54.212 --> 00:12:55.972
I had my heart set on getting some gopchang today.

00:13:05.252 --> 00:13:06.992
You're up 700 grams?

00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:10.722
Yes.

00:13:13.092 --> 00:13:14.962
Mr. Lee has been buying you snacks, hasn't he?

00:13:15.862 --> 00:13:18.432
How could you gain 700 grams just from eating salads?

00:13:19.402 --> 00:13:20.432
I'm sorry.

00:13:22.502 --> 00:13:25.372
A few days ago, I was stuck in traffic,

00:13:25.772 --> 00:13:27.812
and there was a vendor selling fish-shaped pastries.

00:13:28.572 --> 00:13:30.342
You ate street food?

00:13:31.112 --> 00:13:32.242
No.

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:35.952
I was starving on my way out of the gym,

00:13:36.322 --> 00:13:38.182
so at the bakery downstairs,

00:13:39.222 --> 00:13:41.622
I got a pastry, a cream-filled bun,

00:13:42.092 --> 00:13:44.292
a canele, and some macarons,

00:13:45.092 --> 00:13:47.062
and we split them.

00:13:47.332 --> 00:13:49.232
Are you out of your mind?

00:13:50.232 --> 00:13:54.072
But I stopped immediately, and I've been working out every day.

00:13:56.542 --> 00:13:58.902
I'm very on edge these days.

00:13:59.402 --> 00:14:01.942
The last thing I need is you getting on my nerves, Yeong Ra.

00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:06.352
A woman's self-discipline should be as natural as breathing.

00:14:07.712 --> 00:14:08.712
I understand.

00:14:09.552 --> 00:14:10.922
Because of your father...

00:14:16.262 --> 00:14:17.422
Never mind.

00:14:26.332 --> 00:14:27.332
I'm so dead.

00:14:28.572 --> 00:14:30.602
Mom's going to make me weigh myself every day now.

00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:35.612
(Second date with Su Bin)

00:14:35.672 --> 00:14:40.912
(Second date with Su Bin)

00:14:42.652 --> 00:14:45.452
Meet me at 8pm by the parking lot at Yeonji-dong Mart.

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:46.622
Wear something casual.

00:14:46.692 --> 00:14:47.752
Something with loose sleeves.

00:14:49.122 --> 00:14:50.962
Something with loose sleeves?

00:14:51.992 --> 00:14:53.262
Man, where are we even going?

00:14:55.962 --> 00:14:59.162
Gosh, what a pain. It's a hassle to pick out an outfit.

00:15:06.472 --> 00:15:07.972
I'm craving beef gopchang.

00:15:10.642 --> 00:15:13.512
Fried rice made with it is so good.

00:15:14.052 --> 00:15:17.652
No. Starting today, you're back on the salad diet.

00:15:19.182 --> 00:15:23.122
You're right. Mom's going to make me get on the scale twice a week.

00:15:23.762 --> 00:15:25.321
- But, hey... - Gosh, seriously!

00:15:25.322 --> 00:15:29.192
Stop talking. I can't figure out the plot.

00:15:31.662 --> 00:15:32.662
Never mind.

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:36.572
- I can eat it and work out, right? - Just drop it.

00:15:36.942 --> 00:15:39.742
Hey, you never know when your mom might show up for a surprise visit.

00:15:39.942 --> 00:15:43.112
That only happened because we never checked the app after installing it.

00:15:44.012 --> 00:15:45.782
Let's start checking it every hour.

00:15:47.982 --> 00:15:49.722
(Mom's Car, Guri, Yangpyeong)

00:15:51.222 --> 00:15:52.222
What?

00:15:53.022 --> 00:15:54.122
What? What's wrong?

00:15:54.722 --> 00:15:56.092
What? What is it?

00:15:57.162 --> 00:15:59.062
Mom has her Magnolia Society meeting today,

00:15:59.492 --> 00:16:01.262
so why is she heading toward Guri?

00:16:02.132 --> 00:16:05.962
- Maybe it's in Guri or Yangpyeong. - No way.

00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:10.642
It's a key corporate wives' meeting. It has to be in Gangnam.

00:16:11.472 --> 00:16:13.212
I think they even have a regular spot.

00:16:14.342 --> 00:16:16.272
Then where could she be going?

00:16:19.082 --> 00:16:20.912
(Mom's Car)

00:16:25.222 --> 00:16:26.952
Seojong-myeon, Seohu-ri?

00:16:27.992 --> 00:16:29.452
Why is Mom's car all the way out here?

00:16:31.122 --> 00:16:32.522
It's on the move.

00:16:40.402 --> 00:16:43.342
Hey, keep an eye on where it's going for me.

00:16:44.102 --> 00:16:45.272
Why? What are you going to do?

00:16:46.072 --> 00:16:47.072
What?

00:16:47.672 --> 00:16:48.842
I'm just going to check the comments.

00:16:49.942 --> 00:16:53.182
Hey, stop reading comments and work on your webtoon.

00:16:53.452 --> 00:16:55.682
Okay. Just five more minutes, then I'll start drawing.

00:16:56.052 --> 00:16:58.952
Everyone's dying to know what happens in the next episode.

00:17:02.852 --> 00:17:03.862
Finally...

00:17:06.322 --> 00:17:09.062
Okay, just breathe normally. Hold still.

00:17:12.302 --> 00:17:13.632
Okay, good.

00:17:27.812 --> 00:17:30.652
The liver scan reading is higher than last time.

00:17:30.722 --> 00:17:32.552
(Jin Seung Ki, Professor of Surgery)

00:17:32.822 --> 00:17:35.252
This is concerning. The waiting list is still very long.

00:17:36.662 --> 00:17:37.692
Excuse me, Doctor.

00:17:38.392 --> 00:17:40.162
If we find a compatible donor,

00:17:40.692 --> 00:17:43.162
my Woo Jin can get the surgery right away, can't he?

00:17:44.532 --> 00:17:47.972
Yes, but there's still a long waiting list.

00:17:48.332 --> 00:17:49.802
He has a younger sibling.

00:17:50.342 --> 00:17:52.802
His sister is coming to get tested for compatibility.

00:17:54.612 --> 00:17:57.112
Besides yourself,

00:17:57.182 --> 00:18:00.152
I thought you said no one else in your family could be tested.

00:18:02.112 --> 00:18:04.752
I found the daughter I lost long ago.

00:18:05.482 --> 00:18:07.552
She'll be coming in for the test.

00:18:09.762 --> 00:18:13.992
These are the results of a checkup she had recently. Take a look.

00:18:18.562 --> 00:18:20.072
Even for siblings,

00:18:20.172 --> 00:18:23.402
there's only a 25 percent chance of a perfect match.

00:18:23.772 --> 00:18:24.972
So please don't get your hopes up.

00:18:25.242 --> 00:18:26.242
No.

00:18:27.072 --> 00:18:28.542
I have a good feeling about this.

00:18:29.342 --> 00:18:32.282
But please don't let Woo Jin know about any of this.

00:18:32.912 --> 00:18:36.252
I want to tell him after the surgery is over and he's fully recovered.

00:18:36.752 --> 00:18:37.752
Of course.

00:18:38.122 --> 00:18:41.052
Getting his hopes up prematurely would only be more disappointing.

00:18:42.652 --> 00:18:44.262
If his condition keeps getting worse like this,

00:18:44.862 --> 00:18:46.762
what if he develops hepatic encephalopathy?

00:18:47.532 --> 00:18:49.292
The stress is killing me.

00:19:01.542 --> 00:19:02.612
Are you all right?

00:19:03.442 --> 00:19:04.542
I was worried about you.

00:19:04.612 --> 00:19:05.711
(Director Ko)

00:19:05.712 --> 00:19:06.782
(Are you all right? I was worried about you.)

00:19:19.932 --> 00:19:21.461
(Director Ko)

00:19:21.462 --> 00:19:23.232
Could you come over today?

00:19:24.332 --> 00:19:27.402
I have nowhere to grieve, and I can't even allow myself to.

00:19:27.832 --> 00:19:30.801
I've waited all day, and with so much to look into,

00:19:30.802 --> 00:19:32.602
I'm completely stuck here.

00:19:37.282 --> 00:19:39.112
She has nowhere to grieve,

00:19:40.152 --> 00:19:41.782
and she can't even allow herself to grieve.

00:19:46.552 --> 00:19:49.352
Okay. I'll head over right after work.

00:19:49.422 --> 00:19:52.062
(Okay. I'll head over right after work.)

00:19:52.362 --> 00:19:53.792
Wait, are you really going through with this?

00:19:54.232 --> 00:19:56.562
- So you're going for the final bid? - That's the plan.

00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:57.662
But, Mr. Lee.

00:19:57.962 --> 00:20:01.602
You said your meeting with AP's chairman didn't go well.

00:20:02.272 --> 00:20:05.642
- That's right. - Why are you still going for it?

00:20:05.942 --> 00:20:07.772
Because the bidding isn't over yet.

00:20:08.142 --> 00:20:10.581
Once you start climbing, you must reach the top, even if you crawl.

00:20:10.582 --> 00:20:11.842
Only then will you have no regrets.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:21.722
There you are, standing in that same spot again.

00:20:22.622 --> 00:20:23.622
Yes.

00:20:27.962 --> 00:20:28.962
About yesterday...

00:20:29.592 --> 00:20:31.932
I heard your meeting with AP's chairman didn't go well.

00:20:33.202 --> 00:20:34.472
Have you eaten?

00:20:35.632 --> 00:20:37.102
And if I said no, would you have a meal with me?

00:20:38.242 --> 00:20:39.942
Don't ask if you're not going to join me.

00:20:41.812 --> 00:20:43.072
Then why are you here?

00:20:44.112 --> 00:20:45.112
I came to give you this.

00:20:45.682 --> 00:20:47.252
I had some the other day. They're really good.

00:20:47.912 --> 00:20:48.912
You like hotteok, right?

00:20:54.522 --> 00:20:56.552
Why are you going to this trouble for me?

00:20:56.862 --> 00:20:58.022
What, you really don't know?

00:20:58.622 --> 00:21:00.932
I'm showing you I care because you're the woman I like.

00:21:03.162 --> 00:21:05.762
I thought we were done talking about this.

00:21:07.332 --> 00:21:09.172
I would never let someone like that into my life.

00:21:10.802 --> 00:21:12.542
Do you think feelings just end that easily?

00:21:13.512 --> 00:21:14.742
If it were that easy,

00:21:15.172 --> 00:21:17.412
then why did you insist on a reason back then?

00:21:18.082 --> 00:21:19.512
Why was it so important to you?

00:21:20.682 --> 00:21:24.582
For someone who knows how it feels, you're being so cold, and it hurts.

00:21:29.092 --> 00:21:33.062
Those feelings will fade in time.

00:21:37.102 --> 00:21:39.162
I have plans, so I should get going.

00:21:39.732 --> 00:21:40.772
You see, I...

00:21:41.572 --> 00:21:43.272
I'm going to see the final bid through.

00:21:44.942 --> 00:21:47.412
You're going for it, even though you know you'll lose?

00:21:47.742 --> 00:21:48.742
Yes.

00:21:53.142 --> 00:21:55.452
If you pull it off, I'll buy you a meal.

00:21:56.112 --> 00:21:57.122
That's a promise.

00:21:57.452 --> 00:21:59.021
I just said it to show you I'm rooting for you.

00:21:59.022 --> 00:22:00.322
Are you really getting your hopes up?

00:22:01.592 --> 00:22:02.592
I don't know.

00:22:03.292 --> 00:22:05.962
Anyway, I'll keep trying with AP until it works out,

00:22:06.662 --> 00:22:08.792
and I'm going to do the same with you.

00:22:09.192 --> 00:22:11.762
You just do whatever you want.

00:22:12.802 --> 00:22:13.802
Bye.

00:22:35.352 --> 00:22:36.392
Director Ko.

00:22:38.722 --> 00:22:40.562
Eun Oh.

00:22:41.892 --> 00:22:43.702
They said it was okay to go in.

00:22:44.032 --> 00:22:47.102
Of course. It's you, after all.

00:22:55.112 --> 00:22:56.172
I'm sorry.

00:22:57.742 --> 00:22:59.912
You look exhausted.

00:23:01.252 --> 00:23:02.952
I couldn't sleep at all last night.

00:23:06.352 --> 00:23:07.452
I'm just so upset.

00:23:09.292 --> 00:23:10.292
I can only imagine.

00:23:11.722 --> 00:23:13.192
And it's not just that.

00:23:14.632 --> 00:23:15.692
It's you.

00:23:17.102 --> 00:23:18.102
Me?

00:23:18.732 --> 00:23:21.032
We've only just found each other, and now this happens.

00:23:21.932 --> 00:23:24.172
Now that I've found you, I want to see you every day,

00:23:25.002 --> 00:23:27.672
but I can't even smile or be truly happy about it.

00:23:30.312 --> 00:23:32.442
That's understandable, given your situation.

00:23:35.012 --> 00:23:37.682
So what's going to happen now?

00:23:40.652 --> 00:23:42.192
I'll have to throw money at the problem.

00:23:43.592 --> 00:23:45.462
I hear there are people who can arrange that sort of thing.

00:23:46.292 --> 00:23:49.462
For a liver transplant, you must get a compatibility test,

00:23:49.932 --> 00:23:52.662
but the odds... If 100 people get tested,

00:23:52.902 --> 00:23:56.002
the chance of a match is only 1 to 3 percent.

00:23:56.532 --> 00:24:00.372
Even among siblings, it's only a 25 percent chance.

00:24:08.882 --> 00:24:09.882
Eun Oh.

00:24:10.582 --> 00:24:11.752
Would you consider...

00:24:14.222 --> 00:24:17.762
No. Never mind. It's nothing, Eun Oh.

00:24:19.462 --> 00:24:22.632
Why? What is it? Please, just tell me.

00:24:27.472 --> 00:24:28.472
It's just...

00:24:29.602 --> 00:24:32.442
Would you be willing to at least get tested?

00:24:36.042 --> 00:24:37.042
What?

00:24:39.742 --> 00:24:42.252
My husband doesn't know about any of this.

00:24:43.382 --> 00:24:45.352
He didn't want to be a burden on his stepfather,

00:24:45.752 --> 00:24:47.722
so he wanted to hide his illness.

00:24:51.722 --> 00:24:56.032
You've been dealing with this alone?

00:24:58.332 --> 00:24:59.502
At the end of the day,

00:25:00.732 --> 00:25:02.072
he's not his child.

00:25:13.142 --> 00:25:14.182
I'll...

00:25:14.752 --> 00:25:16.312
I'll get tested.

00:25:22.952 --> 00:25:23.962
You'd do that for me?

00:25:26.292 --> 00:25:29.632
I just feel like I have to do this so I won't have any regrets.

00:25:30.262 --> 00:25:34.202
Whatever it takes, I have to try everything I can.

00:25:36.132 --> 00:25:37.242
I'm his mother, after all.

00:25:42.512 --> 00:25:45.512
I can get tested first thing tomorrow.

00:25:55.792 --> 00:25:57.692
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

00:25:59.122 --> 00:26:00.122
Oh, dear.

00:26:02.092 --> 00:26:03.662
Why would she try to find them?

00:26:05.002 --> 00:26:07.001
- Mom, what did you say? - What?

00:26:07.002 --> 00:26:08.802
Oh, nothing. Just thinking out loud.

00:26:13.102 --> 00:26:16.612
I thought she was abandoned. Why would she want to find them?

00:26:17.212 --> 00:26:20.282
No. There must have been another reason.

00:26:20.552 --> 00:26:23.512
Did her birth mother show up? That's it.

00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:25.882
She must have shown up, so Eun Oh didn't have a choice.

00:26:26.782 --> 00:26:29.351
But she was abandoned with no record,

00:26:29.352 --> 00:26:31.122
so we could adopt her.

00:26:31.292 --> 00:26:33.222
How could her mother have found her?

00:26:35.732 --> 00:26:38.432
Right, Eun Oh must have registered her DNA.

00:26:43.642 --> 00:26:44.642
Gang Oh.

00:26:46.772 --> 00:26:47.772
Now,

00:26:48.372 --> 00:26:50.282
you really don't hold anything against your sister?

00:26:51.012 --> 00:26:52.012
What?

00:26:52.682 --> 00:26:54.812
Do you really see her as just your sister?

00:26:55.752 --> 00:26:56.812
Yes, of course.

00:26:57.182 --> 00:26:58.922
Then why did you act that way back then?

00:26:59.852 --> 00:27:03.862
When you found out she was adopted, you were just so cruel to her,

00:27:03.922 --> 00:27:05.362
and you were so angry.

00:27:06.022 --> 00:27:07.992
Mom, I already told you.

00:27:08.292 --> 00:27:11.062
I just felt so hopeless about my future back then.

00:27:11.632 --> 00:27:15.532
And it wasn't that I hated her. I was just hung up on blood ties.

00:27:17.242 --> 00:27:18.342
Blood ties?

00:27:18.502 --> 00:27:22.742
Back then, I wanted to get rich fast and hated working here.

00:27:23.112 --> 00:27:25.142
So everything just came down to money for me.

00:27:25.742 --> 00:27:29.012
"Blood is thicker than water." I was brainwashed by those words.

00:27:30.952 --> 00:27:33.822
"Blood is thicker than water?"

00:27:34.592 --> 00:27:38.762
Mom, when someone just snaps, they can act like a total psycho.

00:27:41.932 --> 00:27:43.862
After what happened with Gang Oh,

00:27:44.302 --> 00:27:47.272
I wonder if you felt differently too, Eun Oh.

00:27:50.872 --> 00:27:53.341
- Great work, everyone. - You too.

00:27:53.342 --> 00:27:57.112
(Shoealls)

00:28:04.852 --> 00:28:07.892
Where's she taking me that she told me to wear loose sleeves?

00:28:08.822 --> 00:28:10.022
Now, I'm really curious.

00:28:26.302 --> 00:28:27.712
This is cute.

00:28:34.712 --> 00:28:36.952
You know, you actually look prettier without makeup.

00:28:37.582 --> 00:28:40.152
No, I take that back. You look better with makeup.

00:28:40.722 --> 00:28:42.752
Make sure you wear makeup when you see your boyfriend.

00:28:49.032 --> 00:28:50.732
He said I was prettier without makeup.

00:28:51.302 --> 00:28:53.102
And he told me to wear makeup for my boyfriend?

00:28:57.902 --> 00:28:59.072
You're home.

00:29:02.412 --> 00:29:03.612
What are you doing home so early?

00:29:04.842 --> 00:29:06.242
I was just feeling a little tired today.

00:29:08.612 --> 00:29:11.422
Did you have fun at your Magnolia Society meeting?

00:29:11.552 --> 00:29:13.852
Do you think I go to those meetings to have fun?

00:29:15.522 --> 00:29:18.022
You need a lesson on your choice of words.

00:29:19.062 --> 00:29:20.732
You should ask, "Did you have a pleasant time?"

00:29:21.492 --> 00:29:23.802
That's the more refined way to ask.

00:29:25.032 --> 00:29:28.372
Did you have a pleasant time at your Magnolia Society meeting?

00:29:29.472 --> 00:29:31.172
We exchanged some useful information.

00:29:32.372 --> 00:29:34.072
Mom's lying.

00:29:35.042 --> 00:29:36.342
I'll see you at dinner.

00:29:37.072 --> 00:29:38.082
Okay.

00:29:49.892 --> 00:29:51.522
I'm so curious.

00:29:51.992 --> 00:29:53.692
Why would Mom have gone to Yangpyeong?

00:29:58.632 --> 00:30:00.002
I have to find out what's going on.

00:30:03.502 --> 00:30:06.002
Just park the car. It's right here.

00:30:07.372 --> 00:30:10.212
Seriously? The place she picked is just a cafe?

00:30:12.312 --> 00:30:13.912
Well, that's anticlimactic, Su Bin.

00:30:16.012 --> 00:30:17.012
Hey!

00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:31.202
- Hey, did you eat yet? - Yes, I ate at home.

00:30:31.262 --> 00:30:32.262
At home?

00:30:32.662 --> 00:30:34.932
I thought you wanted to meet at 8pm because you were busy.

00:30:35.032 --> 00:30:38.742
The launch is keeping you busy. You've eaten too, right?

00:30:39.072 --> 00:30:42.372
Yes, of course. The team and I ordered in.

00:30:43.712 --> 00:30:46.542
Wait, so she suggested 8pm just for me?

00:30:52.782 --> 00:30:57.292
Why the look? If we meet at 8pm, we get 4 hours until midnight.

00:30:58.122 --> 00:30:59.192
It's nothing.

00:30:59.492 --> 00:31:02.762
It's just that tea at 8pm seemed lame. That's why.

00:31:03.292 --> 00:31:05.432
Oh, really? Well, that's not what we're doing.

00:31:05.762 --> 00:31:06.762
Come on!

00:31:11.842 --> 00:31:14.612
Hey. What is this place?

00:31:15.542 --> 00:31:16.712
A knitting shop?

00:31:16.912 --> 00:31:20.682
Today's activity is knitting scarves to exchange with each other.

00:31:20.982 --> 00:31:22.952
You want me to knit?

00:31:24.052 --> 00:31:26.652
- Come on, Su Bin. This is too much. - Hey.

00:31:27.222 --> 00:31:30.792
Didn't we agree that I'd be the one choosing where we go?

00:31:31.192 --> 00:31:33.622
I know, but it's still a bit much, you know?

00:31:33.722 --> 00:31:35.692
You might change your mind once you try it.

00:31:35.992 --> 00:31:38.632
We're not allowed to go home until we finish these.

00:31:39.532 --> 00:31:42.432
Let's each pick the colour we want. I want...

00:31:43.102 --> 00:31:44.172
yellow.

00:31:45.172 --> 00:31:46.272
For me...

00:31:47.002 --> 00:31:48.072
I'm good with anything.

00:31:48.942 --> 00:31:52.182
Anything's fine? Then I'll pick one out for you.

00:31:54.282 --> 00:31:56.412
I think you'd look good in any of them, but...

00:32:00.552 --> 00:32:02.592
What? Is this one too bright?

00:32:04.022 --> 00:32:05.562
What's your personal colour?

00:32:06.422 --> 00:32:08.362
I don't know. I've never done that test.

00:32:10.602 --> 00:32:14.432
- You said you liked yellow, right? - Yes. You put it in like this,

00:32:15.772 --> 00:32:16.902
then loop it around.

00:32:17.442 --> 00:32:20.202
- Okay, hold on. In like this... - Loop.

00:32:20.272 --> 00:32:21.272
And loop.

00:32:23.672 --> 00:32:26.842
Su Bin. How about I just buy you a scarf?

00:32:27.852 --> 00:32:31.982
Look. Do you think the people here can't afford to buy a scarf,

00:32:32.052 --> 00:32:33.722
so that's why they're knitting?

00:32:37.122 --> 00:32:39.362
I know, right? Why is everyone here doing this?

00:32:39.762 --> 00:32:43.332
Just try it. You'll get it once you're finished.

00:32:43.592 --> 00:32:46.202
Why? What, because you're some...

00:32:46.262 --> 00:32:48.832
third-generation heir, you can't do this sort of thing?

00:32:49.302 --> 00:32:52.372
What are you talking about? That's ridiculous.

00:32:53.142 --> 00:32:54.242
Show me again.

00:32:55.272 --> 00:32:56.972
If I put my mind to it, I can do anything.

00:32:58.512 --> 00:33:00.142
It'll be easier if we're looking from the same angle.

00:33:00.512 --> 00:33:01.552
Look.

00:33:04.122 --> 00:33:05.122
See? Like this.

00:33:15.562 --> 00:33:20.002
He has nice hands, too. His fingers are so long.

00:33:22.572 --> 00:33:24.272
And his eyelashes are long, too.

00:33:27.872 --> 00:33:30.242
So that's what he looks like when he smiles without realising it.

00:33:30.812 --> 00:33:31.812
What?

00:33:33.042 --> 00:33:34.482
Su Bin, look at this.

00:33:35.352 --> 00:33:38.252
What? Oh, okay.

00:33:39.922 --> 00:33:40.922
You dropped a stitch.

00:33:44.922 --> 00:33:47.122
In and loop.

00:33:51.132 --> 00:33:53.862
Yes, right here. This part! How did you do this?

00:34:19.592 --> 00:34:20.592
I'm all done.

00:34:23.292 --> 00:34:25.302
- Hey! Wait, stay just like that! - What?

00:34:26.702 --> 00:34:27.702
Okay.

00:34:31.702 --> 00:34:33.802
Wow, you're a real natural at this.

00:34:35.212 --> 00:34:38.412
- Hey, this is kind of fun... - Excuse me, we'll be closing soon.

00:34:38.812 --> 00:34:39.812
Okay.

00:34:40.142 --> 00:34:41.152
Okay.

00:34:43.482 --> 00:34:44.952
Wow, it's that late already?

00:34:46.152 --> 00:34:48.052
Why haven't you gotten much done? What were you doing?

00:34:48.752 --> 00:34:50.592
You're just a really fast knitter.

00:34:51.422 --> 00:34:53.792
I'll finish this and give it to you on our next date.

00:34:55.232 --> 00:34:57.032
Didn't you say you couldn't go home until you finished?

00:35:00.562 --> 00:35:01.872
So, does that mean I don't have to go home?

00:35:08.012 --> 00:35:09.012
Let's go home.

00:35:14.512 --> 00:35:15.512
That's pretty cool.

00:35:16.352 --> 00:35:19.082
Time flies when you do this. It's more fun than I thought.

00:35:19.452 --> 00:35:22.722
- It's great for clearing your head. - Right? It's great for de-stressing.

00:35:24.052 --> 00:35:25.422
So is that why you wanted to come here today?

00:35:25.992 --> 00:35:29.062
Yes. You've had a lot on your mind lately.

00:35:29.232 --> 00:35:32.862
When something big is coming up, your thoughts get tangled, right?

00:35:35.972 --> 00:35:39.302
Thanks. You really helped me clear my head.

00:35:39.702 --> 00:35:43.212
Really? Yes! Today's date was a success!

00:35:45.182 --> 00:35:47.282
Here. An early Christmas present.

00:35:48.382 --> 00:35:49.782
An early Christmas present?

00:35:51.652 --> 00:35:53.822
So he's saying he doesn't want to see me on Christmas.

00:36:00.362 --> 00:36:01.362
Did you have fun too?

00:36:04.302 --> 00:36:06.102
Yes, totally.

00:36:08.302 --> 00:36:11.702
Me too. Come on. I'll take you home today.

00:36:13.102 --> 00:36:14.102
Really?

00:36:49.112 --> 00:36:50.112
That's two down.

00:36:52.142 --> 00:36:53.212
One more to go.

00:37:05.292 --> 00:37:07.222
What a lame date. So lame.

00:37:09.692 --> 00:37:10.832
I mean...

00:37:11.462 --> 00:37:14.832
How can I see her as a woman if I don't even get to look at her?

00:37:15.732 --> 00:37:17.902
Knitting to clear my head? What kind of date is that?

00:37:19.572 --> 00:37:20.572
Unbelievable.

00:37:28.282 --> 00:37:29.282
Gosh, whatever.

00:37:30.552 --> 00:37:32.052
I only have to go out with her...

00:37:32.922 --> 00:37:34.182
one more time, and then I'm done.

00:37:46.902 --> 00:37:47.902
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:37:48.532 --> 00:37:50.972
I absolutely have to be at the construction site today.

00:37:52.202 --> 00:37:54.772
I know. You told me last night.

00:37:56.812 --> 00:37:57.812
Good luck.

00:37:57.882 --> 00:38:01.712
Don't worry, I'll be fine. It'd be overkill if you came anyway.

00:38:03.912 --> 00:38:07.282
- Okay, I'll get going then. - Okay.

00:38:13.492 --> 00:38:15.232
She's probably going to see her birth mother.

00:38:16.662 --> 00:38:19.732
It's not like Eun Oh to miss something this important.

00:38:25.272 --> 00:38:28.442
(Cheong Ah University Hospital)

00:38:32.182 --> 00:38:35.452
When you get to the hospital, you'll meet with a doctor first.

00:38:36.112 --> 00:38:37.882
They'll ask for your consent and things like that.

00:38:41.422 --> 00:38:43.222
(Damga)

00:38:43.322 --> 00:38:44.862
I'm so nervous.

00:38:45.122 --> 00:38:47.461
Hey, I'm supposed to be the nervous one.

00:38:47.462 --> 00:38:49.532
You started this, and you're making me more nervous.

00:38:50.092 --> 00:38:51.562
I wish Eun Oh were here.

00:38:52.032 --> 00:38:54.002
I know, Mom. Even though my sister is tiny,

00:38:54.062 --> 00:38:58.042
she seemed so big in Dad's role. So bold and fearless.

00:38:59.242 --> 00:39:00.272
That's enough.

00:39:02.212 --> 00:39:03.742
Yes, you can come in now.

00:39:04.612 --> 00:39:05.612
Okay.

00:39:08.652 --> 00:39:10.882
(Damga Corp, R and D Center)

00:39:23.492 --> 00:39:25.432
Looking at these ingredients, this must be your secret recipe.

00:39:26.062 --> 00:39:28.232
Yes. I marinate it once with this,

00:39:28.632 --> 00:39:31.672
and a second time with this special marinade.

00:39:31.772 --> 00:39:34.412
The natural enzymes must've deepened the meat's flavour.

00:39:35.142 --> 00:39:39.142
It was exceptionally tender before. I was curious what the secret was.

00:39:39.342 --> 00:39:41.612
If this dish gets chosen,

00:39:41.912 --> 00:39:44.622
I'll reveal the secret ingredient ratios then.

00:39:45.552 --> 00:39:48.592
It's a healthy method, so customers can enjoy it worry-free.

00:39:49.122 --> 00:39:51.692
Exactly. These days, food must be more than delicious.

00:39:51.762 --> 00:39:53.192
It needs to leave a lasting impression on customers.

00:39:53.862 --> 00:39:55.262
It seemed a shame to keep it all to ourselves,

00:39:55.332 --> 00:39:57.532
so I'm the one who called HQ to ask if we could sell it.

00:39:58.432 --> 00:39:59.632
We're glad you did.

00:40:07.542 --> 00:40:09.642
Ms. Ji Eun Oh's test is going well.

00:40:20.222 --> 00:40:22.252
From her liver size to her blood vessels...

00:40:23.252 --> 00:40:24.762
She's already a suitable match, anyway.

00:40:27.422 --> 00:40:28.832
Take a deep breath.

00:40:29.532 --> 00:40:30.562
Now, hold it.

00:40:34.062 --> 00:40:36.432
You're taking this test of your own free will, correct?

00:40:37.572 --> 00:40:39.872
A living donor liver transplant is the best option, you see.

00:40:41.112 --> 00:40:43.612
Well, just because you're siblings doesn't guarantee a match,

00:40:44.212 --> 00:40:45.612
so don't get your hopes up too high.

00:40:48.082 --> 00:40:51.682
- Why isn't Eun Oh here today? - Well...

00:40:51.982 --> 00:40:55.192
It's a personal matter, so it's not really my place to say.

00:40:55.652 --> 00:40:56.652
Su Jeong.

00:40:56.722 --> 00:40:59.062
I really can't. You should ask Eun Oh yourself.

00:40:59.162 --> 00:41:02.332
She's never missed a day of school. That's why I'm asking.

00:41:05.332 --> 00:41:06.332
All right, fine.

00:41:09.972 --> 00:41:11.972
It's so obvious he likes Eun Oh.

00:41:14.172 --> 00:41:15.412
(Wow, I can't believe this outfit is 68 years old.)

00:41:15.472 --> 00:41:16.512
(Bini, gorgeous colours. I love the vibe.)

00:41:16.572 --> 00:41:18.442
(- I'd totally buy this outfit. - Grandma looks just like a model.)

00:41:18.512 --> 00:41:19.512
(She's so elegant.)

00:41:20.612 --> 00:41:23.512
The more I read this, the more fascinating it gets.

00:41:23.582 --> 00:41:24.752
Tell me about it.

00:41:25.622 --> 00:41:27.452
I was embarrassed at first,

00:41:28.052 --> 00:41:30.052
but here I am reading these with you.

00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:32.822
Wait a second. What's this?

00:41:33.562 --> 00:41:34.662
What does this say?

00:41:35.032 --> 00:41:38.432
Hello. I'm the vice president of the Senior Model Association.

00:41:38.702 --> 00:41:43.072
I think the woman in your video would make a great senior model.

00:41:43.172 --> 00:41:47.242
If she's interested, please have her contact us at this number.

00:41:47.302 --> 00:41:49.572
What is this saying?

00:41:53.412 --> 00:41:58.422
Oh, my! They're asking you to be a senior model, Ok Rye!

00:41:58.482 --> 00:42:00.782
Oh, my goodness. No way.

00:42:01.622 --> 00:42:02.622
Oh, dear.

00:42:02.692 --> 00:42:03.792
(Jamun Medical Devices)

00:42:03.852 --> 00:42:05.062
Welcome.

00:42:05.892 --> 00:42:07.392
Could you take care of this customer for a moment?

00:42:07.692 --> 00:42:09.162
Yes, I'll give it a try.

00:42:10.262 --> 00:42:11.262
Welcome.

00:42:12.362 --> 00:42:14.602
Well, my mother-in-law mentioned this,

00:42:15.202 --> 00:42:17.102
and I was thinking of getting one for my father.

00:42:17.732 --> 00:42:19.972
In that case, why don't you try this first?

00:42:20.342 --> 00:42:21.342
Here, please lie down.

00:42:21.772 --> 00:42:23.142
Come on, Dad. Lie down.

00:42:23.912 --> 00:42:26.182
This is an eco-friendly product.

00:42:26.782 --> 00:42:27.782
It's nice and warm, isn't it?

00:42:28.152 --> 00:42:29.782
Oh, my. That's nice and warm.

00:42:30.452 --> 00:42:33.922
What do you call it? It feels like it's improving my circulation.

00:42:34.952 --> 00:42:37.152
My mother-in-law gets a lot of use out of hers.

00:42:38.062 --> 00:42:39.762
Dad, what do you think?

00:42:40.262 --> 00:42:41.262
Do you like it?

00:42:42.792 --> 00:42:46.362
If you keep using it, it'll help with your aches and pains.

00:42:47.562 --> 00:42:48.602
Let's get it then, Dad.

00:42:49.172 --> 00:42:50.172
I'll buy it for you.

00:42:54.402 --> 00:42:58.282
Depression is no big deal. It happens when you get old.

00:42:59.642 --> 00:43:01.182
At my age,

00:43:02.182 --> 00:43:03.552
nothing ever happens.

00:43:03.912 --> 00:43:06.252
So you just naturally start to feel down.

00:43:16.392 --> 00:43:17.392
Come on, Da Jeong.

00:43:18.002 --> 00:43:19.332
Why do you care what Gyeong Hun thinks?

00:43:20.332 --> 00:43:22.502
You just saw a daughter taking such good care of her father.

00:43:23.202 --> 00:43:25.202
I'm supposed to leave mine alone while he's on antidepressants?

00:43:31.312 --> 00:43:32.312
Gyeong Hun.

00:43:32.882 --> 00:43:33.882
It's me, your sister.

00:43:34.712 --> 00:43:36.982
I'm texting because we need to talk about something important.

00:43:38.852 --> 00:43:41.652
You know Dad's turning 90 soon.

00:43:52.062 --> 00:43:55.072
And he's been living alone for ten years now.

00:43:55.932 --> 00:43:57.202
(Gyeong Hun)

00:43:57.272 --> 00:44:00.502
You know it's not possible for me to take him in,

00:44:01.642 --> 00:44:03.742
so to make sure Dad isn't lonely in his final years,

00:44:05.412 --> 00:44:06.982
do you think you could have him move in with you?

00:44:07.712 --> 00:44:08.712
Give me that.

00:44:09.712 --> 00:44:11.522
Wait, what is this?

00:44:12.082 --> 00:44:13.082
What are you talking about?

00:44:13.882 --> 00:44:15.452
Did you really plan to send your father...

00:44:15.752 --> 00:44:18.192
to live with your brother without even talking to me first?

00:44:19.522 --> 00:44:20.992
What else am I supposed to do?

00:44:23.492 --> 00:44:26.202
I can't stand seeing my dad live all by himself anymore.

00:44:30.232 --> 00:44:31.232
Dad...

00:44:32.372 --> 00:44:34.302
He's been on antidepressants.

00:44:35.342 --> 00:44:37.412
Why didn't you tell me that?

00:44:37.772 --> 00:44:39.942
You should have told me this. Come on.

00:44:40.542 --> 00:44:42.482
Is this because I'm not making enough money right now?

00:44:42.812 --> 00:44:43.812
Da Jeong.

00:44:45.782 --> 00:44:48.552
Did my words go in one ear and out the other?

00:44:49.292 --> 00:44:51.892
I told you he could come live with us.

00:44:52.192 --> 00:44:55.732
What? Mother, you said he could live with us?

00:44:55.832 --> 00:44:59.932
Yes. Su Bin and I can share a room, and he can have mine.

00:45:01.062 --> 00:45:02.402
No, I couldn't ask you to do that.

00:45:02.672 --> 00:45:04.072
Why not? Of course, we can do it.

00:45:04.372 --> 00:45:07.002
We can just kick out either Ji Wan or Ji Hyuk.

00:45:07.242 --> 00:45:09.672
Mother offered to let your father move in, right?

00:45:10.672 --> 00:45:13.082
But still, there's Gyeong Hun.

00:45:13.882 --> 00:45:16.712
You wrote that text to your brother,

00:45:17.012 --> 00:45:18.352
but you couldn't hit send, could you?

00:45:19.052 --> 00:45:20.922
You were afraid he'd say no, weren't you?

00:45:23.392 --> 00:45:24.392
Mother.

00:45:25.762 --> 00:45:28.162
Are you really sure you'd be okay with my father living here?

00:45:30.632 --> 00:45:31.702
And you're really okay with this?

00:45:32.262 --> 00:45:34.062
- Of course! - Of course! Honestly...

00:45:38.302 --> 00:45:40.442
- Honey, it's Gyeong Hun. - Answer it.

00:45:42.842 --> 00:45:45.182
Hello? Gyeong Hun?

00:45:45.612 --> 00:45:47.982
Hey. Sorry it took me so long to call back.

00:45:48.452 --> 00:45:51.882
Yes. Isn't it like 1am in Seattle now?

00:45:52.522 --> 00:45:54.452
We moved today. We just finished unpacking.

00:45:55.592 --> 00:45:58.662
- You moved? - Yes, into a four-bedroom place.

00:45:59.522 --> 00:46:00.522
So Dad can come and live with us.

00:46:01.692 --> 00:46:02.992
You want Dad to live with you?

00:46:13.572 --> 00:46:15.312
Apparently, my sister-in-law suggested it first.

00:46:16.072 --> 00:46:18.342
Her mother passed away at the beginning of the year.

00:46:19.882 --> 00:46:22.612
So she told him he'd regret it for the rest of his life...

00:46:23.412 --> 00:46:24.852
if he didn't ask our father to come live with them.

00:46:26.152 --> 00:46:28.152
Still, that means leaving the country.

00:46:28.792 --> 00:46:30.492
Do you think your father will be happy with that?

00:46:31.522 --> 00:46:34.622
- He'll be thrilled. - Da Jeong!

00:46:35.332 --> 00:46:36.391
- Sang Cheol! - Father.

00:46:36.392 --> 00:46:38.302
- My goodness. - Oh, Ok Rye.

00:46:40.502 --> 00:46:44.332
My Gyeong Hun asked me to come.

00:46:45.142 --> 00:46:46.302
He wants me to live with him.

00:46:47.372 --> 00:46:49.412
- "Ok Rye?" - "Ok Rye?"

00:46:56.482 --> 00:46:59.782
Wait, how did they become friends just by being neighbours?

00:47:00.882 --> 00:47:02.692
You heard him. He said he had no friends left.

00:47:03.322 --> 00:47:06.762
Wow, I've never seen your father look so happy.

00:47:07.792 --> 00:47:09.262
He must have been so lonely.

00:47:13.002 --> 00:47:14.532
I'm sorry, honey. Okay?

00:47:16.802 --> 00:47:19.041
What about Mother once my dad leaves?

00:47:19.042 --> 00:47:20.242
She'll feel so empty.

00:47:22.742 --> 00:47:23.742
Kim Da Jeong.

00:47:25.012 --> 00:47:26.012
Stay with me for a long time.

00:47:26.912 --> 00:47:29.252
For a long time? How long?

00:47:30.312 --> 00:47:32.922
At this rate, we probably have at least another 20 years together.

00:47:33.952 --> 00:47:38.152
No, maybe 30, looking at our parents.

00:47:38.922 --> 00:47:39.922
Thirty years?

00:47:40.892 --> 00:47:42.592
Oh, you're right.

00:47:43.492 --> 00:47:44.492
Don't worry.

00:47:45.232 --> 00:47:47.762
I won't burden you with being the sole provider until then.

00:47:48.232 --> 00:47:49.472
I'll be right there with you.

00:47:50.272 --> 00:47:51.432
Don't be ridiculous.

00:47:51.942 --> 00:47:54.142
I'll be the one providing for you until the day I die. Honestly...

00:47:56.542 --> 00:47:58.482
This is exactly why I married you.

00:48:06.622 --> 00:48:07.852
Mom, Gang Oh.

00:48:08.122 --> 00:48:10.292
- So how was it today? - It felt like it was a shoo-in.

00:48:10.852 --> 00:48:12.422
I think Mom's galbi is going to be a new menu item.

00:48:12.992 --> 00:48:13.992
Wow, really?

00:48:14.962 --> 00:48:18.232
My gosh. You really worked hard, Mom.

00:48:19.162 --> 00:48:20.162
Goodness.

00:48:21.502 --> 00:48:22.532
Hey, I'm exhausted.

00:48:23.072 --> 00:48:24.072
I'm heading to bed.

00:48:30.342 --> 00:48:31.342
Gang Oh.

00:48:31.842 --> 00:48:34.282
Did something happen to upset Mom today?

00:48:34.612 --> 00:48:37.212
No, I don't think so. She was proud of the great response.

00:48:38.422 --> 00:48:40.482
So is she just really exhausted then?

00:48:41.122 --> 00:48:43.622
Of course, she is. Our mom is a huge introvert,

00:48:43.692 --> 00:48:44.962
and she had to do a demo at corporate HQ.

00:48:47.822 --> 00:48:48.832
Yes, that makes sense.

00:48:55.032 --> 00:48:56.102
That little brat.

00:48:58.102 --> 00:48:59.642
I can't believe she didn't say anything.

00:49:05.042 --> 00:49:06.042
My gosh.

00:49:13.852 --> 00:49:16.522
(Bid Envelope)

00:49:18.922 --> 00:49:21.122
- Your submission is complete. - Okay.

00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:23.532
(Bidder: Lee Ji Hyuk)

00:49:29.572 --> 00:49:31.272
- Shall we go? - Yes.

00:49:32.502 --> 00:49:35.812
Wait, Mr. Lee, you're here for the final bidding?

00:49:36.112 --> 00:49:37.112
Yes.

00:49:42.182 --> 00:49:43.182
For crying out loud.

00:49:44.582 --> 00:49:45.582
This is ridiculous.

00:49:49.552 --> 00:49:51.592
Thank you for seeing this through with me.

00:49:52.592 --> 00:49:54.362
Regardless of the outcome, we've learned a lot from this too.

00:49:55.062 --> 00:49:56.762
Your fighting spirit and tenacity...

00:49:57.032 --> 00:49:58.432
It's something we never would have dreamed of.

00:49:59.102 --> 00:50:01.302
If that's how it seemed, it's all thanks to my father.

00:50:01.772 --> 00:50:05.372
- Pardon? - He told me to go for it.

00:50:06.142 --> 00:50:07.272
Whether it worked out or not,

00:50:07.702 --> 00:50:10.012
I figured it'd be better than regretting not trying.

00:50:10.872 --> 00:50:11.882
I see.

00:50:12.582 --> 00:50:15.182
You really left it all on the table. So how do you feel?

00:50:16.112 --> 00:50:17.112
Relieved.

00:50:18.112 --> 00:50:20.322
I know the feeling. I feel relieved myself.

00:50:21.052 --> 00:50:22.052
What?

00:50:23.252 --> 00:50:25.092
(Yoon Tae Sik Vice President, AP Group)

00:50:27.992 --> 00:50:28.992
Hello, this is Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:50:29.062 --> 00:50:31.832
Mr. Lee. The chairman wants to see you now.

00:50:32.232 --> 00:50:35.771
- Pardon? - I'll text you the contract needs.

00:50:35.772 --> 00:50:36.872
Prepare them and come.

00:50:38.272 --> 00:50:39.972
What do you mean by that?

00:50:41.102 --> 00:50:43.472
He's handing the company to you, Mr. Lee.

00:50:45.112 --> 00:50:46.112
What?

00:51:24.934 --> 00:51:27.252
(Exclusive Negotiation Agreement)

00:51:27.652 --> 00:51:31.292
What are you staring at so dreamily? Weren't you expecting this at all?

00:51:33.092 --> 00:51:34.862
You're a very convincing actor, Mr. Chairman.

00:51:35.532 --> 00:51:37.232
You were just acting that day, weren't you?

00:51:37.592 --> 00:51:40.002
I made my decision the day you came to see me.

00:51:41.162 --> 00:51:44.102
I want to hand my company over to someone who will grow it well.

00:51:44.772 --> 00:51:48.242
What would I do with all that money from the sale at my age, anyway?

00:51:49.412 --> 00:51:50.412
But...

00:51:51.512 --> 00:51:52.912
I needed to be sure.

00:51:54.442 --> 00:51:57.482
Whether you had just ambition, or the grit to back it up too.

00:51:59.252 --> 00:52:00.882
The kind of man who finishes what he starts...

00:52:01.582 --> 00:52:05.052
would make it to the final bid, so I waited to see.

00:52:06.622 --> 00:52:08.192
Thank you for believing in me.

00:52:08.762 --> 00:52:09.862
I won't let you down.

00:52:14.362 --> 00:52:16.002
Please take good care of this company.

00:52:28.412 --> 00:52:29.952
This is our company logo.

00:52:30.712 --> 00:52:33.482
I had this made once I made up my mind.

00:52:34.022 --> 00:52:35.452
To help me let go of the company.

00:52:37.422 --> 00:52:39.522
I wanted to give it to the new owner as a gift.

00:52:42.962 --> 00:52:43.962
Now,

00:52:44.892 --> 00:52:46.102
it's not my company anymore.

00:52:57.542 --> 00:52:59.212
This is gorgeous.

00:53:02.852 --> 00:53:04.852
The height of the sink...

00:53:05.782 --> 00:53:06.782
and the furniture too.

00:53:07.152 --> 00:53:09.792
Everything is exactly how I wanted it.

00:53:10.222 --> 00:53:11.252
Really?

00:53:11.822 --> 00:53:14.662
Eun Oh!

00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:17.092
Hello.

00:53:18.092 --> 00:53:20.462
These kitchen cabinets. They're from AP Kitchen, right?

00:53:21.302 --> 00:53:22.302
Yes.

00:53:23.132 --> 00:53:26.572
Ma'am, I'll personally handle the after-sales service for these.

00:53:26.972 --> 00:53:27.972
Pardon me?

00:53:28.772 --> 00:53:31.712
Because AP Kitchen's head office handles all after-sales service.

00:53:33.912 --> 00:53:36.752
Hey, don't get ahead of yourself. We only submitted the bid today.

00:53:36.812 --> 00:53:40.652
No, the results are in. It's official. We're acquiring them.

00:53:40.982 --> 00:53:42.692
I even signed the contract with the chairman.

00:53:43.552 --> 00:53:47.022
Really? But how? All in one day?

00:53:48.362 --> 00:53:49.492
Ms. Ji Eun Oh.

00:53:49.932 --> 00:53:51.902
Shouldn't you get back to work? The client is still here.

00:53:53.102 --> 00:53:55.162
Make sure everything suits the client's lifestyle.

00:53:55.502 --> 00:53:58.272
Do a final check. The details are everything.

00:54:00.572 --> 00:54:03.542
- Ma'am, please look over here. - Okay.

00:54:07.082 --> 00:54:09.282
Are you happy with the interior design?

00:54:10.112 --> 00:54:11.282
Of course.

00:54:11.652 --> 00:54:14.422
Ms. Ji was so meticulous with every detail.

00:54:14.882 --> 00:54:18.762
My husband especially loves the tea room.

00:54:18.992 --> 00:54:20.292
You mean the wooden floor in there?

00:54:20.692 --> 00:54:24.592
Ms. Ji treated that floor with natural oils herself.

00:54:26.262 --> 00:54:27.602
You didn't have to say that.

00:54:28.132 --> 00:54:29.672
They should appreciate all your hard work.

00:54:32.202 --> 00:54:34.202
Okay, I get it. Just head back to the office.

00:54:34.502 --> 00:54:35.642
Everyone must be waiting for you.

00:54:35.712 --> 00:54:37.912
We're going together. You're our turnkey team leader.

00:54:38.442 --> 00:54:40.442
I already asked Su Jeong to get everything set up.

00:54:51.962 --> 00:54:56.262
Thank you for all your hard work. You must visit after I move in.

00:54:57.162 --> 00:54:58.902
It was a pleasure working on it.

00:54:59.732 --> 00:55:01.932
- Take your time and look around. - I will.

00:55:02.332 --> 00:55:05.942
I could just look at it all day. You two should get going.

00:55:28.962 --> 00:55:30.092
Are you tired?

00:55:49.752 --> 00:55:51.482
- Here you go. - Thanks.

00:55:55.592 --> 00:55:56.922
Ji Eun Oh, you owe me dinner.

00:56:00.762 --> 00:56:02.962
I only said that because I thought you'd lose.

00:56:03.592 --> 00:56:06.202
I know. But I won.

00:56:07.962 --> 00:56:09.372
A promise is a promise.

00:56:10.232 --> 00:56:11.802
Tell me about it on the way.

00:56:12.742 --> 00:56:14.142
About how you found your birth parents.

00:56:15.842 --> 00:56:18.642
Not my parents. Just my birth mother.

00:56:19.712 --> 00:56:21.442
She said my father passed away.

00:56:24.382 --> 00:56:25.422
I see.

00:56:26.722 --> 00:56:27.952
What about your birth mother?

00:56:28.622 --> 00:56:29.892
What's she like?

00:56:30.622 --> 00:56:32.392
How did she say she lost you?

00:56:33.422 --> 00:56:34.462
The thing is...

00:56:36.662 --> 00:56:39.332
She's someone I already knew.

00:56:40.662 --> 00:56:42.272
You already knew her?

00:56:43.802 --> 00:56:48.202
You know that client I had for the art space job?

00:56:49.042 --> 00:56:50.312
Yes, I remember her. And?

00:56:51.712 --> 00:56:53.082
It was her.

00:56:54.382 --> 00:56:55.712
The one who gave birth to me.

00:56:56.652 --> 00:56:57.712
What?

00:56:58.412 --> 00:57:00.152
No, how is that even possible?

A trip to Europe with a friend.

00:57:11.532 --> 00:57:13.432
But work could make that difficult.

Yes, Ms. Shin.

Find a short interior design course at a New York fashion school.

00:57:35.492 --> 00:57:38.992
Actually, Paris would be fine too. Anywhere in Europe will do.

00:57:42.292 --> 00:57:43.362
Yeong Ra, come on. It's time to go home.

Why are they suddenly holding hands and running?

00:57:47.732 --> 00:57:48.802
What's going on here?

00:57:48.902 --> 00:57:53.402
Remember when Mom almost caught us? Running away with you was so fun...

00:57:53.472 --> 00:57:54.572
that I turned it into an episode.

00:57:55.142 --> 00:57:57.142
You thought that was fun?

00:57:57.312 --> 00:58:00.442
Yes. My heart was pounding,

00:58:01.612 --> 00:58:02.882
but it was such a thrill.

00:58:03.452 --> 00:58:04.452
It was a rush, you know?

00:58:04.782 --> 00:58:06.982
You've really got guts.

00:58:08.422 --> 00:58:09.992
Right, my mom.

Hey, does this have a feature...

00:58:15.862 --> 00:58:18.432
that sends an alert when my mom's car starts moving?

00:58:19.502 --> 00:58:23.232
I don't think so. I already set it to give you an hourly reminder.

00:58:24.472 --> 00:58:25.602
That's not what I mean.

00:58:26.642 --> 00:58:28.772
I think I might have to follow my mom.

00:58:29.142 --> 00:58:30.342
Follow Director Ko?

00:58:31.112 --> 00:58:32.112
Why?

00:58:32.942 --> 00:58:34.942
Something's fishy about Yangpyeong.

00:58:35.552 --> 00:58:37.252
What if she's having an affair?

00:58:38.152 --> 00:58:39.652
Come on. There's no way.

00:58:40.152 --> 00:58:42.352
That's why we have to find out.

00:58:42.952 --> 00:58:45.122
No, I have to be sure.

00:58:46.322 --> 00:58:47.862
If only for my dad's sake.

00:58:50.292 --> 00:58:54.202
But how are you going to know when to follow her?

00:58:54.502 --> 00:58:56.702
I'll just follow her using the GPS tracker.

00:58:57.702 --> 00:58:59.672
On a day when her route seems strange?

00:59:01.142 --> 00:59:03.712
Good point. You're pretty smart.

00:59:04.712 --> 00:59:08.712
Thank you, everyone. To AP Group!

00:59:09.082 --> 00:59:11.052
- To AP Group! - To AP Group!

00:59:12.722 --> 00:59:14.552
- Thank you. - Thank you.

- Well done. - Mr. Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:59:16.352 --> 00:59:17.852
Seriously, congratulations.

00:59:18.752 --> 00:59:20.992
Man, you're incredible. Seriously.

00:59:21.892 --> 00:59:23.532
I think so, too.

00:59:25.602 --> 00:59:27.732
There's that obnoxious Lee Ji Hyuk again.

00:59:28.802 --> 00:59:32.842
Since you're talking so casually, I'll ask you like your boss.

00:59:34.342 --> 00:59:35.672
Why did you miss work yesterday?

00:59:41.012 --> 00:59:43.752
- I bet we're getting a raise. - Mr. Jo.

00:59:44.182 --> 00:59:45.452
Mr. Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:59:45.922 --> 00:59:48.222
Seriously, stop giving everyone a heart attack.

00:59:48.482 --> 00:59:50.452
Sung Guk looked like he was about to lose his mind.

00:59:51.292 --> 00:59:53.762
But he keeps things exciting, doesn't he?

00:59:54.162 --> 00:59:55.162
Here, Mr. Lee.

00:59:55.932 --> 00:59:59.162
It's not time to get drunk yet. We have lots of work tomorrow.

01:00:00.032 --> 01:00:01.032
Of course.

01:00:04.572 --> 01:00:07.272
It didn't even take as long as I thought it would.

01:00:08.402 --> 01:00:10.542
But what if you're a match?

01:00:11.312 --> 01:00:12.482
The odds are low.

01:00:13.082 --> 01:00:14.511
They said there was only a 25 percent chance...

01:00:14.512 --> 01:00:15.682
of a perfect match.

01:00:16.312 --> 01:00:17.912
I just got tested. That's all.

01:00:20.652 --> 01:00:24.292
But what will you do if you're in that 25 percent?

01:00:25.662 --> 01:00:26.662
As if.

01:00:28.092 --> 01:00:30.862
Su Jeong, you know more about this than I do, don't you?

01:00:33.302 --> 01:00:36.372
When will you meet the twin brother you mentioned earlier?

01:00:39.542 --> 01:00:41.672
They say twins have a special connection.

01:00:42.102 --> 01:00:43.442
You never felt anything?

01:00:44.212 --> 01:00:45.242
Su Jeong.

01:00:47.812 --> 01:00:49.082
Oh, okay.

01:00:55.252 --> 01:00:57.552
You must be really happy to finally meet him.

01:00:59.092 --> 01:01:00.662
So? When are you going to meet him?

01:01:02.932 --> 01:01:06.362
He's not feeling well, so I can't see him for a while.

01:01:07.462 --> 01:01:09.302
What? If he's not well, you should see him even sooner.

01:01:10.232 --> 01:01:11.402
Just how sick is he?

01:01:13.402 --> 01:01:14.502
Is it terminal?

01:01:15.602 --> 01:01:17.012
It's nothing like that.

01:01:18.672 --> 01:01:19.682
Then what is it?

01:01:20.742 --> 01:01:22.912
What kind of illness keeps you from meeting someone?

01:01:23.082 --> 01:01:24.812
There's no such illness in the world.

01:01:27.422 --> 01:01:29.392
There is. Just drop it.

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:34.622
No, I can't just drop it.

01:01:35.062 --> 01:01:36.232
None of this makes any sense.

01:01:40.762 --> 01:01:42.302
His liver is in really bad shape,

01:01:43.902 --> 01:01:46.042
so he's waiting for a liver transplant.

01:01:47.642 --> 01:01:48.642
What?

01:01:51.942 --> 01:01:52.942
Don't tell me...

01:01:54.082 --> 01:01:56.952
Did they ask you to take the compatibility test?

01:02:01.252 --> 01:02:02.282
Yesterday...

01:02:03.222 --> 01:02:05.052
Is that why you missed work?

01:02:10.262 --> 01:02:11.262
That's what it was.

01:02:13.202 --> 01:02:15.462
- No, it's not like that... - Come here.

01:02:24.242 --> 01:02:25.372
Have a seat over here.

01:02:29.782 --> 01:02:32.482
What are you doing? Everyone's watching.

01:02:32.922 --> 01:02:33.952
Tell me.

01:02:34.622 --> 01:02:36.322
How much do you really know about your biological mother?

01:02:38.122 --> 01:02:39.762
This whole "coincidence" thing...

01:02:40.262 --> 01:02:41.522
Have you actually verified it?

01:02:43.432 --> 01:02:46.032
What are you trying to say?

01:02:46.202 --> 01:02:48.502
It's too much of a coincidence. Don't you think it's strange?

01:02:50.072 --> 01:02:51.802
You just happened to meet her as a client.

01:02:52.232 --> 01:02:53.402
And it turns out she's your birth mother.

01:02:55.402 --> 01:02:57.042
And now, your brother needs a liver transplant.

01:02:59.712 --> 01:03:00.882
All the pieces...

01:03:02.082 --> 01:03:03.212
fit together too perfectly, don't you think?

01:03:46.422 --> 01:03:48.692
(Our Golden Days)

01:03:49.122 --> 01:03:51.231
- Vice President Park Seong Jae. - Get in there, quickly.

01:03:51.232 --> 01:03:54.102
Don't worry. I won't tell them I was with you.

01:03:54.162 --> 01:03:56.502
I must have missed something.

01:03:56.672 --> 01:03:59.572
Do you really think Director Ko is having an affair?

01:03:59.642 --> 01:04:02.672
I just feel like I need to know what my mom is doing...

01:04:03.042 --> 01:04:04.312
and what she's up to.

01:04:05.042 --> 01:04:07.442
Doesn't it seem strange to you? This whole liver transplant thing...

01:04:07.512 --> 01:04:09.782
is really bothering me. In life, things don't just...

01:04:09.852 --> 01:04:10.952
fall into place so perfectly like this.

01:04:11.012 --> 01:04:15.452
Did I ask you to work for me? Do you think I'd just exploit you?

01:04:15.622 --> 01:04:16.792
I'm sorry.

01:04:18.052 --> 01:04:19.662
I'll give it all up.
