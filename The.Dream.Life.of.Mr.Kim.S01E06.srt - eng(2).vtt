THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:55.619
Good thing I've been exercising.

00:00:55.702 --> 00:00:56.995
Let's go.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.413

Damn it.

00:01:22.896 --> 00:01:26.692
Hello, this is Kim Nak-su,
general manager of Sales Team 1 at ACT.

00:01:26.775 --> 00:01:28.777
I read your diary, sir.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.737
If you could please help me out

00:01:30.821 --> 00:01:32.781
and offer me
even the smallest piece of guidance,

00:01:32.864 --> 00:01:35.158
I'll be forever in your debt.

00:01:35.784 --> 00:01:36.993
Please help me.

00:01:38.245 --> 00:01:39.121
Sir?

00:01:40.372 --> 00:01:43.125
Sunday at 11:00 a.m.

00:01:43.208 --> 00:01:45.585
Meet me at the peak of Wollyong Mountain.

00:01:46.086 --> 00:01:48.088
Excuse me? Sir!

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:53.260
Wollyong Mountain at 11:00 a.m.?

00:01:57.472 --> 00:01:58.807
Damn it.

00:02:00.642 --> 00:02:02.519
Why couldn't we just talk on the phone?

00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:04.521
Why did he make me climb all this way?

I'll keep that in mind.

00:03:17.636 --> 00:03:20.347

Job interview!

00:03:34.444 --> 00:03:37.197
I would go meet my client
instead of going to the hospital.

00:03:38.824 --> 00:03:41.451
He's crazy. He really is insane.

00:03:44.204 --> 00:03:46.873
You're the one who hired me at ACT.

00:03:46.957 --> 00:03:47.833
Gosh.

00:03:51.503 --> 00:03:52.420
Oh my.

00:03:52.504 --> 00:03:53.672
Gosh.

00:03:53.755 --> 00:03:56.591
How did you let things get this bad?

00:03:57.092 --> 00:03:59.719
I suppose I wasn't good enough.

00:03:59.803 --> 00:04:03.682
Of course you weren't.
There's no need to explain everything.

00:04:04.516 --> 00:04:05.475
Yes, sir.

00:04:11.606 --> 00:04:13.733
You've got about 100
to 200 million won, right?

00:04:13.817 --> 00:04:15.694
-What?
-Yes or no?

00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:17.904
Why would you ask that?

00:04:17.988 --> 00:04:19.573
What do you mean, why?

00:04:19.656 --> 00:04:23.869
So I can shove it right down
the throats of your superiors!

00:04:24.536 --> 00:04:27.122
I'll handle the delivery myself
so nothing goes wrong.

00:04:27.205 --> 00:04:29.749
-Excuse me?
-I'll take about five percent.

00:04:31.126 --> 00:04:34.254
Sir? I mean no disrespect,

00:04:34.337 --> 00:04:37.674
but did you use such methods
to return to headquarters?

00:04:37.757 --> 00:04:39.634
No, of course not!

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.761
Then why are you telling me--

00:04:41.845 --> 00:04:47.225
Because I don't see
the same spark in you that I had.

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:48.476
No.

00:04:50.437 --> 00:04:53.940
The thing about being
the Safety Management team leader

00:04:54.024 --> 00:04:57.694
is that it may look like you're
nothing more than a useless figurehead,

00:04:57.777 --> 00:05:02.699
but it's actually a position
where headquarters can assign you

00:05:02.782 --> 00:05:04.159
all sorts of secret tasks.

00:05:04.242 --> 00:05:08.580
Is that so?
I haven't been given a single one.

00:05:09.247 --> 00:05:10.665
You'll find out soon enough.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.169
You've come at a very lucky time.

00:05:14.252 --> 00:05:16.922
I'm sorry, what do you mean?

00:05:17.923 --> 00:05:21.968
It's been over ten years since I retired.

00:05:22.052 --> 00:05:23.094
"Ten years."

00:05:23.178 --> 00:05:26.973
But I still hear things
about what's going on at the company.

00:05:27.557 --> 00:05:30.101
Please, just give it to me straight.

00:05:31.394 --> 00:05:34.981
When headquarters gives you an assignment,

00:05:35.774 --> 00:05:37.150
tackle it head-on.

00:05:38.526 --> 00:05:42.405
That will be your new lifeline.

00:05:44.491 --> 00:05:47.035
You're going to need this.

00:05:48.203 --> 00:05:49.454
Right.

00:05:56.795 --> 00:05:58.380

Let's bring Kim Nak-su back to HQ, sir.

00:06:25.573 --> 00:06:26.658
What are you talking about?

00:06:26.741 --> 00:06:29.703
I'm saying you can bring
Kim Nak-su back if you want.

00:06:35.208 --> 00:06:36.626
What do you mean?

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:39.045
Why now? It's so sudden.

00:06:41.423 --> 00:06:42.716
It's not that sudden.

00:06:43.633 --> 00:06:46.803
Heo Tae-hwan quit.
That opened up some room.

00:06:49.264 --> 00:06:50.306
Cut the crap.

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:52.559
Why are you suggesting this?

00:06:56.354 --> 00:06:57.522
Damn it…

00:06:57.605 --> 00:06:58.690
What?

00:06:58.773 --> 00:07:00.025
It's Asan.

00:07:00.108 --> 00:07:01.151
The factory? What about it?

00:07:03.653 --> 00:07:05.405
It's a long story,

00:07:05.488 --> 00:07:08.867
but the Asan factory
is the HR Team's biggest battle this year.

00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:14.247
That's why we need Nak-su to help us out.

00:07:17.125 --> 00:07:18.418
Are you sure about this?

EPISODE 6
LIFELINE

00:07:39.064 --> 00:07:41.900
When headquarters gives you an assignment,

00:07:42.609 --> 00:07:44.194
tackle it head-on.

00:07:44.277 --> 00:07:47.906
That will be your new lifeline.

00:07:48.531 --> 00:07:50.533
Nothing's happened for days.

00:07:51.242 --> 00:07:53.036
Did he even know what he was saying?

00:07:55.914 --> 00:07:57.123
Come here.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.546
You haven't done the safety check
for four days.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.890
INSPECTION RESULTS

00:08:14.682 --> 00:08:15.934
Are you serious?

00:08:18.186 --> 00:08:20.271
I wouldn't have a clue, even if I checked.

00:08:20.355 --> 00:08:21.606
Besides,

00:08:22.524 --> 00:08:26.111
you told me to keep a low profile
and leave, remember?

00:08:28.988 --> 00:08:31.950
What are you, a child?

00:08:33.034 --> 00:08:36.037
You got to win a race
to get some lunch in this place.

00:08:36.788 --> 00:08:39.082
So, why can't I act like a child?

00:08:40.375 --> 00:08:41.543
Sure you can.

00:08:42.168 --> 00:08:44.838
As long as you take responsibility
like an adult

00:08:44.921 --> 00:08:47.632
if an accident happens
on a day you signed off on.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.552
Before you worry about accidents,

00:08:50.635 --> 00:08:54.430
how about focusing on
the safety exercises,

00:08:55.181 --> 00:08:58.184
which improve your flexibility
and lower the risk of injuries?

00:08:58.268 --> 00:09:00.603
I'd really love to do them properly,

00:09:00.687 --> 00:09:02.730
but the person demonstrating at the front

00:09:02.814 --> 00:09:04.732
is just so incredibly stiff.

00:09:07.777 --> 00:09:08.820
Jeez.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.791
Sung-gu!

00:09:24.794 --> 00:09:25.670
Hey.

00:09:35.638 --> 00:09:36.890
Mr. Kim!

00:09:37.599 --> 00:09:39.100
I have to meet the Production Team.

00:09:39.184 --> 00:09:40.768
Okay. Call me later.

00:09:40.852 --> 00:09:43.062
Okay. I'm running late.

00:09:43.146 --> 00:09:44.272
Right. Go on.

00:09:44.355 --> 00:09:46.608
He used to work under me at HQ.

00:09:46.691 --> 00:09:49.235
I told him to send an email,

00:09:49.319 --> 00:09:51.321
but he came to report to me in person.

00:09:51.404 --> 00:09:53.740
Gosh. That kid has no street smarts.

00:09:53.823 --> 00:09:54.866
Oh dear.

00:09:56.951 --> 00:09:57.911
Where did she go?

00:09:58.703 --> 00:10:00.079
I wonder if he's eaten.

00:10:16.221 --> 00:10:19.224
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
Okay? It's fine…

00:10:21.434 --> 00:10:22.727
She's here.

00:10:23.228 --> 00:10:24.562
You just stay here.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.111
This car's amazing. What a smooth ride.

00:10:32.195 --> 00:10:34.948
Sang-cheol, this car is amazing!

00:10:35.031 --> 00:10:36.032
Oh, yes. Right.

00:10:38.326 --> 00:10:42.497
"Of course I do.
I know you'll never pass."

00:10:42.997 --> 00:10:43.873
Stop it.

00:10:44.499 --> 00:10:46.918
Did you pass
the pet funeral director exam?

00:10:49.003 --> 00:10:50.797
I heard the test
was especially hard this time.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.966
-Here. Have some iced coffee.
-Thank you.

00:10:53.049 --> 00:10:53.925
Well, I'm off.

00:10:54.968 --> 00:10:56.219
Wait.

00:10:58.137 --> 00:10:59.764
My wife was a bit rash.

00:11:01.599 --> 00:11:04.185
Rash is her middle name.

00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:07.605
So if you could let this go,
just this once…

00:11:11.234 --> 00:11:12.235
Please reconsider this.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.154
I'm so sorry.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.701
What should I do, Ha-yeong?

00:11:20.326 --> 00:11:21.286
Forget it.

00:11:21.786 --> 00:11:22.996
This is pathetic. Just take it.

00:11:23.079 --> 00:11:24.289
-Okay, fine.
-Yes.

00:11:24.372 --> 00:11:26.082
-Go ahead.
-Thanks for the car.

00:11:26.165 --> 00:11:28.251
Honey, please. Ha-jin!

00:11:28.334 --> 00:11:30.044
Just this once. Please.

00:11:30.128 --> 00:11:31.796
Come on.

00:11:31.879 --> 00:11:33.089
-Hey!
-Ha-jin.

00:11:33.172 --> 00:11:34.674
What's up with you?

00:11:36.342 --> 00:11:38.219
-I'm sorry.
-What?

00:11:38.303 --> 00:11:40.013
Again. A little louder.

00:11:44.851 --> 00:11:48.021
-I'm sorry. I am.
-There you go. That's it.

00:11:48.104 --> 00:11:50.690
I'll never look down on you again,
I promise.

00:11:50.773 --> 00:11:53.234
So just give the car back.

00:11:53.318 --> 00:11:55.486
-Fine, I get it. I'm leaving.
-Okay.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:56.946
Wait, Ha-jin!

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.281
-I'm so sorry!
-Hey!

00:11:58.364 --> 00:12:00.033
-Ha-jin, I'm so sorry!
-Hey!

00:12:00.116 --> 00:12:02.118
Please, Ha-jin.
Can't you let it go just this once?

00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:04.495
I'm really sorry. What was I thinking?

00:12:04.579 --> 00:12:07.290
-Ha-jin, please just let this go! Please?
-Hey.

00:12:10.084 --> 00:12:11.294
That's enough.

00:12:13.004 --> 00:12:15.340
I've seen the 90-million-won performance,
so that's enough.

00:12:15.423 --> 00:12:18.259
Hey, what would I even do with your car?

00:12:18.343 --> 00:12:20.178
Unbelievable.

00:12:21.763 --> 00:12:24.307
I'll just borrow it for the day.
Is that okay?

00:12:25.725 --> 00:12:28.019
Of course. That's totally fine.

00:12:28.102 --> 00:12:30.063
I'm really sorry, Ha-jin.

00:12:30.146 --> 00:12:32.523
Oh gosh. I seriously love you.

00:12:32.607 --> 00:12:35.526
Me too! I love you so much!

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:36.778
-What?
-I mean…

00:12:36.861 --> 00:12:39.072
I'm sorry. Thank you so much.

00:12:39.155 --> 00:12:41.657
And now, Ms. Park Ha-jin,

00:12:41.741 --> 00:12:43.701
-the real estate agent!
-The real estate agent!

00:12:43.785 --> 00:12:45.495
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

00:12:49.665 --> 00:12:51.167
-I'm off, then.
-Okay.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.252
You did great.

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:58.466
Sorry, but there's just one thing.

00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:00.968
I have to do this

00:13:01.052 --> 00:13:03.513
to get rid of this heavy feeling

00:13:04.597 --> 00:13:05.807
in my heart.

00:13:06.933 --> 00:13:08.059
You understand, right?

00:13:24.409 --> 00:13:25.993
Here we go.

00:13:31.499 --> 00:13:32.792
Wait…

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:39.048
Yes! Now this is
what a new car's all about.

00:13:42.135 --> 00:13:43.344
This is so satisfying.

00:13:49.225 --> 00:13:50.184
Chin strap.

00:13:58.192 --> 00:14:00.236
Shouldn't this be oiled?

00:14:01.654 --> 00:14:02.572
What?

00:14:03.448 --> 00:14:05.992
-Mr. Kim!
-Sung-gu. Hey.

00:14:06.075 --> 00:14:08.161
-I have to meet the Logistics Team.
-Really?

00:14:08.244 --> 00:14:10.121
The Logistics Team…

00:14:10.204 --> 00:14:11.539
Hey, that's a hazard.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.709
Excuse me.
Shouldn't someone be cleaning this up?

00:14:15.251 --> 00:14:16.544
-Okay, see you later.
-Okay.

00:14:16.627 --> 00:14:17.503
Call me.

00:14:17.587 --> 00:14:18.838
Clean it up. Quickly.

00:14:20.631 --> 00:14:22.800
You shouldn't leave
things like this on the floor.

00:14:30.933 --> 00:14:33.686
SAFETY MANAGEMENT TEAM

00:14:35.813 --> 00:14:37.148
What's taking him so long?

00:14:39.275 --> 00:14:40.401
JUNG SUNG-GU

00:14:41.694 --> 00:14:43.613
"When are you coming?"

00:14:45.656 --> 00:14:47.200
No, I'll just wait.

00:14:49.202 --> 00:14:50.578
What's this?

00:14:57.502 --> 00:14:58.461
Mr. Kim!

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:01.923
Man, this place was hard to find.
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:15:02.006 --> 00:15:03.716
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

00:15:04.258 --> 00:15:05.384
All done for the day?

00:15:06.135 --> 00:15:07.178
Yes.

00:15:09.805 --> 00:15:10.681
Right.

00:15:10.765 --> 00:15:11.849
Have a seat.

00:15:11.933 --> 00:15:14.018
You must be busy.
I'm not interrupting, am I?

00:15:14.101 --> 00:15:16.687
No, it's fine.
I'm pretty much done for the day.

00:15:16.771 --> 00:15:17.855
Oh, right!

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:23.027
I figured you might not
be eating properly without me around.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.904
Oh my.

00:15:24.987 --> 00:15:27.031
-Okay. Drink it.
-Gosh.

00:15:27.114 --> 00:15:30.243
I should have visited you sooner.
I'm sorry about that.

00:15:30.326 --> 00:15:33.037
No, you must be busy.
So, how are things at the office?

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.082
Well… Ik-hyeon, Song-hee, and I

00:15:36.165 --> 00:15:39.252
are just doing
whatever Do Jin-woo tells us to.

00:15:40.211 --> 00:15:42.547
Things aren't really settled yet.

00:15:43.339 --> 00:15:46.217
They say you don't appreciate the spring
until after the flowers are gone.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.095
We all say, "Things were so much better
when Mr. Kim was here."

00:15:49.178 --> 00:15:50.179
I'm sorry.

00:15:50.972 --> 00:15:54.016
I should've protected you guys
to the very end.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.895
I know, right?
When are you coming back, sir?

00:16:04.694 --> 00:16:06.112
How should I know?

00:16:08.406 --> 00:16:09.282
I…

00:16:11.742 --> 00:16:13.411
Oh, Ms. Lee.

00:16:14.036 --> 00:16:15.871
Mr. Jung, say hello.

00:16:17.748 --> 00:16:20.167
This is Ms. Lee Ju-young,
our factory supervisor.

00:16:20.251 --> 00:16:21.794
She's our star worker.

00:16:21.877 --> 00:16:25.381
Hello. It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Jung Sung-gu from Sales Team 1.

00:16:26.841 --> 00:16:28.467
Do you have something to report?

00:16:29.802 --> 00:16:31.887
The dog's food bowl is attracting flies.

00:16:32.513 --> 00:16:35.600
And the poop bag's full,
so take it out front.

00:16:36.601 --> 00:16:37.935
I washed the water bowl.

00:17:19.101 --> 00:17:20.978
Regardless of all this,

00:17:21.062 --> 00:17:23.939
wouldn't it be better to maintain
your connection to Mr. Baek?

00:17:24.774 --> 00:17:28.152
You don't have anyone else
to count on in the Sales Team, anyway.

00:17:28.235 --> 00:17:31.489
Shouldn't you put in more effort
at times like this

00:17:31.572 --> 00:17:33.324
to secure your career?

00:17:47.505 --> 00:17:50.341
Jeez, where's my laptop?

00:18:02.395 --> 00:18:03.604
Here it is.

00:18:11.529 --> 00:18:12.863
JEALOUSY, MY STRENGTH
KIM SU-GYEOM

00:18:12.947 --> 00:18:13.948
"Kim Su-gyeom"?

00:18:18.703 --> 00:18:19.787
LOAN REPAYMENT NOTICE

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:21.330
"Loan"?

00:18:23.124 --> 00:18:25.042
REPAYMENT DETAILS
AS OF JULY 2025

00:18:25.126 --> 00:18:26.293
TOTAL LOAN
30,000,000 WON

00:18:26.377 --> 00:18:29.296
Man, I love this day-drinking culture.
It's the best.

00:18:34.593 --> 00:18:35.928
Kim Su-gyeom?

00:18:37.888 --> 00:18:39.390
Did you all know about this?

00:18:44.645 --> 00:18:46.564
LOAN REPAYMENT NOTICE

00:18:46.647 --> 00:18:48.357
It says the number is not in service.

00:18:48.441 --> 00:18:50.860
-Try again.
-I've tried more than ten times.

00:18:50.943 --> 00:18:52.570
Hey, he's in LA right now.

00:18:52.653 --> 00:18:53.779
-What?
-What?

00:18:56.407 --> 00:18:58.826
Wait, did that bastard
take out loans in our names and run?

00:18:58.909 --> 00:19:00.327
I can't believe it.

00:19:00.411 --> 00:19:02.705
He probably took all
our investment money, too.

00:19:02.788 --> 00:19:04.874
What a complete scumbag!

00:19:06.333 --> 00:19:07.334
Wait. Hold on.

00:19:07.418 --> 00:19:10.337
So how much was the loan
he took out in our names?

00:19:11.672 --> 00:19:13.716
Thirty million won each.

00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:14.842
-Thirty million?
-Thirty?

00:19:14.925 --> 00:19:16.051
Thirty million.

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:21.724
-I was going to get a new car.
-Jeez.

00:19:21.807 --> 00:19:23.893
So we just have to send the money

00:19:23.976 --> 00:19:25.811
to the account listed here, right?

00:19:25.895 --> 00:19:27.646
I promised my girlfriend we'd go to Ibiza.

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:28.856
All right, payment sent.

00:19:28.939 --> 00:19:29.982
Me too.

00:19:31.108 --> 00:19:33.569
-I'll be broke for a while.
-Tell me about it.

00:19:36.155 --> 00:19:37.072
Hold on.

00:19:38.032 --> 00:19:40.284
You just paid the money back?

00:19:40.367 --> 00:19:43.746
Yes. We should take care
of stuff like this right away.

00:19:43.829 --> 00:19:45.247
So what now?

00:19:45.331 --> 00:19:47.625
What do you mean, "What now?"
Let's just go back.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:51.045
-We need to prep for school.
-Well, Korea was fun.

00:19:51.128 --> 00:19:52.421
It was pretty fun.

00:19:53.506 --> 00:19:54.924
Goodbye. Let's never meet again.

00:19:55.007 --> 00:19:56.050
Bye.

00:19:56.926 --> 00:19:58.135
Take care.

00:20:09.438 --> 00:20:10.564
You're not leaving?

00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:20.115
Damn it. That bastard.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:24.119
He could have at least paid
the electricity bill before running off.

00:20:27.998 --> 00:20:30.084
Lee Jeong-hwan, you son of a bitch!

00:20:46.684 --> 00:20:48.561
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SIM GANG-HUN

00:20:51.063 --> 00:20:54.275
-The number you have dialed is--
-Damn it, it's off again.

00:20:55.359 --> 00:20:57.611
How am I supposed to get ready

00:20:57.695 --> 00:20:59.405
if he's not telling me anything?

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.743
Damn it. He's a total fraud.

00:21:05.786 --> 00:21:08.038
I should've known when he scarfed down

00:21:08.122 --> 00:21:10.916
the herbal duck soup
and five whole scallion pancakes.

00:21:12.376 --> 00:21:14.879
I was an idiot for believing him.

00:21:16.755 --> 00:21:17.965
Darn it.

00:21:21.677 --> 00:21:22.636
Jeez.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.514
EMPLOYEE DORMITORY

00:21:27.474 --> 00:21:28.934
Who's that?

00:21:34.815 --> 00:21:35.941
What are you doing?

00:21:36.025 --> 00:21:36.942
Honey!

00:21:37.026 --> 00:21:39.778
What brings you here?
You didn't even call.

00:21:39.862 --> 00:21:41.739
It's dangerous this late at night.

00:21:42.948 --> 00:21:44.992
I came to surprise you.

00:21:45.075 --> 00:21:46.452
You really surprised me.

00:21:46.535 --> 00:21:48.245
And where did you get this car?

00:21:50.122 --> 00:21:51.415
I…

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.376
won the lottery.

00:21:56.086 --> 00:21:58.756
Come on, stop joking around.
Seriously, where'd you get this?

00:21:58.839 --> 00:22:00.758
It's true.
I'll tell you everything inside.

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:03.594
-Wait, I have to throw this out.
-Okay.

00:22:09.016 --> 00:22:12.102
Really? It's Ha-yeong's?

00:22:12.186 --> 00:22:13.938
Of course.

00:22:14.647 --> 00:22:16.732
Sang-cheol got her a new one.

00:22:16.815 --> 00:22:20.069
You don't want to wreck
someone else's car. You should be careful.

00:22:22.321 --> 00:22:23.238
Here you go.

00:22:24.531 --> 00:22:26.533
Come on in!

00:22:26.617 --> 00:22:30.412
Wow, what's all this stuff?
Gosh, this is heavy.

00:22:31.455 --> 00:22:33.707
Okay. Here we go.

00:22:34.583 --> 00:22:35.709
Let's see…

00:22:41.131 --> 00:22:43.550
-You haven't had dinner, have you?
-Nope.

00:22:43.634 --> 00:22:45.928
I'll make you a nice hotpot.

00:22:46.011 --> 00:22:47.221
Okay.

00:22:48.097 --> 00:22:49.515
-That goes up there.
-Here?

00:22:49.598 --> 00:22:51.266
-Yes, the freezer.
-All right.

00:22:52.851 --> 00:22:55.270
So, did Sang-cheol start his company?

00:22:55.354 --> 00:22:56.563
Ages ago.

00:22:56.647 --> 00:22:59.441
He's hired people
and even had an opening ceremony.

00:22:59.984 --> 00:23:01.819
I see.

00:23:02.569 --> 00:23:04.405
Why do you ask?

00:23:05.239 --> 00:23:07.574
No reason. Can I help with anything?

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:11.036
Wow, look at you. What's the occasion?

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.956
Come on, we'll finish sooner if I help.
What should I do?

00:23:15.833 --> 00:23:19.294
After doing housework for a few months,
you finally get it, don't you?

00:23:19.378 --> 00:23:22.464
If you calculate the hourly wage
for housework, it's no joke.

00:23:22.548 --> 00:23:23.799
Okay. You're right.

00:23:27.219 --> 00:23:28.595
All right.

00:23:32.891 --> 00:23:34.059
-Honey.
-Oh, you startled me.

00:23:34.143 --> 00:23:35.477
I almost cut my hand.

00:23:35.561 --> 00:23:36.687
Honey.

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.564
What are you doing? Stop it.

00:23:38.647 --> 00:23:42.234
-You're staying the night, right?
-No, I'm going home.

00:23:42.317 --> 00:23:43.402
-Don't go.
-Come on.

00:23:43.485 --> 00:23:44.611
-Don't go.
-Stop it.

00:23:44.695 --> 00:23:46.488
-Are you crazy?
-How about another baby?

00:23:46.572 --> 00:23:47.865
Another baby?

00:23:47.948 --> 00:23:49.491
-I want a daughter.
-Oh my…

00:23:49.575 --> 00:23:50.993
-I really want a daughter.
-Stop it.

00:23:51.076 --> 00:23:53.245
Su-gyeom isn't cute anymore.
He doesn't listen to me.

00:23:53.328 --> 00:23:55.414
-Oh gosh! Seriously, stop it!
-What?

00:23:56.999 --> 00:23:58.083
My goodness.

00:23:58.625 --> 00:23:59.710
Jeez.

00:24:07.134 --> 00:24:08.385
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

00:24:08.886 --> 00:24:10.929
I can tell this will be awesome.

00:24:11.013 --> 00:24:12.389
-All right.
-Ta-da!

00:24:12.473 --> 00:24:14.391
-Oh my.
-All right.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:17.394
Here you go.

00:24:18.729 --> 00:24:19.646
Me too.

00:24:20.439 --> 00:24:22.775
Here you go.

00:24:24.276 --> 00:24:25.903
-Ready?
-Cheers.

00:24:25.986 --> 00:24:26.945
Cheers.

00:24:29.156 --> 00:24:30.491
What's that?

00:24:31.366 --> 00:24:32.367
What?

00:24:32.451 --> 00:24:33.786
That flyer.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:35.954
I don't know.

00:24:37.331 --> 00:24:40.125
You taped it up yourself.
What do you mean, you don't know?

00:24:40.209 --> 00:24:42.294
I don't know. Why is this even here?

00:24:42.377 --> 00:24:43.295
I have no idea.

00:24:44.671 --> 00:24:48.258
Man, it's been so long since I had
a home-cooked meal. It looks delicious.

00:24:53.806 --> 00:24:55.974
How much longer do you have to stay here?

00:24:59.311 --> 00:25:02.064
Well, it's not a position
they give to just anyone.

00:25:02.147 --> 00:25:05.067
I'll stay until they find
a suitable replacement, I guess.

00:25:06.276 --> 00:25:08.153
So you can't go back to headquarters.

00:25:08.946 --> 00:25:10.989
I told you. It's executive training.

00:25:12.074 --> 00:25:14.159
-You can't go back.
-I told you, that's not it!

00:25:14.243 --> 00:25:16.537
If you keep yelling at me, I'm going home.

00:25:19.665 --> 00:25:20.874
Jeez.

00:25:23.168 --> 00:25:26.338
Stop denying everything
and explain it to me.

00:25:26.421 --> 00:25:29.299
I need to understand
what's going on, don't I?

00:25:52.906 --> 00:25:54.324
What are you going to do?

00:25:54.825 --> 00:25:55.868
What is there to do?

00:25:55.951 --> 00:25:59.580
Are you going to stick it out,
or are you going to quit?

00:26:00.122 --> 00:26:01.999
There's still a chance I'll go back.

00:26:02.082 --> 00:26:03.292
Okay, fine.

00:26:03.375 --> 00:26:06.044
But what if you can't?

00:26:07.713 --> 00:26:08.589
Oh, come on.

00:26:11.842 --> 00:26:13.385
Don't quit out of anger.

00:26:14.928 --> 00:26:17.639
I know it's selfish of me to ask,
but please don't.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.058
We need a plan for the next few years.

00:26:20.684 --> 00:26:22.477
And you know all about our loan.

00:26:22.561 --> 00:26:25.856
Su-gyeom's a freshman now.
He may pay for his own wedding,

00:26:27.316 --> 00:26:29.193
but we have to see him through graduation.

00:26:30.485 --> 00:26:34.323
Don't be tempted by the severance pay,
and just hang in there a little longer.

00:26:36.867 --> 00:26:37.743
I…

00:26:38.827 --> 00:26:42.039
I can help now.

00:26:43.707 --> 00:26:44.625
What do you mean?

00:26:48.462 --> 00:26:50.923
This wasn't how I wanted to tell you.

00:26:51.798 --> 00:26:53.008
What is it? Tell me.

00:26:55.969 --> 00:26:58.847
I passed the real estate license exam.

00:26:59.473 --> 00:27:00.349
What?

00:27:00.432 --> 00:27:03.727
I studied for it without you knowing,
and I passed.

00:27:06.104 --> 00:27:07.397
I can't believe you.

00:27:08.148 --> 00:27:09.441
What do you take me for?

00:27:10.442 --> 00:27:11.693
What are you talking about?

00:27:11.777 --> 00:27:14.112
I don't think of you as some superhero

00:27:14.196 --> 00:27:15.739
or MacGyver.

00:27:16.823 --> 00:27:19.785
I saw you as the Kim Nak-su I know
and made my decision.

00:27:25.249 --> 00:27:26.375
I mean…

00:27:27.292 --> 00:27:31.255
You think earning money
is as easy as it sounds?

00:27:33.215 --> 00:27:35.092
Do you think I…

00:27:37.928 --> 00:27:40.847
No, I just…
I really don't want you to do this.

00:27:43.433 --> 00:27:44.518
Darn it.

00:27:47.396 --> 00:27:48.772
You should go.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.914
She really passed
the real estate license exam?

00:28:56.465 --> 00:28:57.591
If I get fired…

00:29:00.135 --> 00:29:01.762
and she's the only one working…

00:29:04.139 --> 00:29:05.390
An excellent choice.

00:29:05.974 --> 00:29:07.392
Once you deposit the down payment,

00:29:07.476 --> 00:29:08.894
-we'll proceed…
-Gosh.

00:29:08.977 --> 00:29:10.604
-…with the contract.
-That's right.

00:29:11.605 --> 00:29:12.939
Hey!

00:29:13.023 --> 00:29:14.066
What are you doing?

00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:15.442
Go!

00:29:17.652 --> 00:29:18.779
Yes.

00:29:18.862 --> 00:29:20.280
Your ID card and…

00:29:20.364 --> 00:29:22.783
Please, stop.
You're making me uncomfortable.

00:29:22.866 --> 00:29:23.909
-Sang-cheol!
-Let go of me.

00:29:23.992 --> 00:29:25.160
Sang-cheol!

00:29:34.211 --> 00:29:36.213
The deposit, contract fee,
and installments.

00:29:36.296 --> 00:29:37.964
The payments are quite manageable.

00:29:47.641 --> 00:29:48.850
Who was that guy?

00:29:48.934 --> 00:29:51.853
He's just someone I met for work.
Just stop bothering me.

00:29:51.937 --> 00:29:53.480
You really met for work, right?

00:29:53.563 --> 00:29:54.981
Right?

00:29:55.065 --> 00:29:56.108
Gosh.

00:29:56.942 --> 00:30:00.237
-Just don't drink with him.
-Just clean up the house!

00:30:24.052 --> 00:30:24.928
Honey.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.850
Honey.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.561
Honey.

00:30:44.322 --> 00:30:45.407
Honey…

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:46.908
No!

00:30:52.581 --> 00:30:55.709
This isn't right!

00:31:02.048 --> 00:31:04.509
He was quiet for a while.
Why is he at it again?

00:31:06.553 --> 00:31:08.346
Just leave him be.

00:31:08.972 --> 00:31:10.682
Imagine how tormented he must be.

00:31:18.732 --> 00:31:20.192
Kim Nak-su!

00:31:20.692 --> 00:31:22.944
Who is he?

00:31:23.028 --> 00:31:25.030
I'm a general manager.

00:31:25.113 --> 00:31:28.116
I rose through the ranks
without skipping a single promotion.

00:31:28.992 --> 00:31:31.745
I'm a public recruit from
a prestigious university. Elite of elites.

00:31:31.828 --> 00:31:34.748
I'm 99.9 percent sure
I'll be an executive next year.

00:31:34.831 --> 00:31:35.749
Got that?

00:31:35.832 --> 00:31:38.251
The dog's food bowl
is attracting flies.

00:31:38.335 --> 00:31:41.213
And the poop bag's full,
so take it out front.

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:52.224
I bought an apartment in Seoul

00:31:52.307 --> 00:31:53.642
with my own money!

00:31:54.267 --> 00:31:57.103
And I sent my son to college!

00:31:57.187 --> 00:31:59.189
I've worked at a major corporation

00:31:59.272 --> 00:32:00.607
for 25 years

00:32:01.149 --> 00:32:03.527
as a general manager!

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:05.362
You assholes!

00:32:23.129 --> 00:32:24.422
Darn it!

00:32:31.555 --> 00:32:33.557
Why are you doing this to me?

00:32:39.771 --> 00:32:41.064
What is all this?

00:32:52.617 --> 00:32:56.037
MR. BAEK JEONG-TAE

00:33:00.917 --> 00:33:01.835
Kim Nak-su.

00:33:02.711 --> 00:33:03.920
Yes, sir.

00:33:04.004 --> 00:33:06.673
Hey, why is it so noisy?
Can you hear me?

00:33:06.756 --> 00:33:08.925
Yes, I can hear you.

00:33:09.593 --> 00:33:11.928
You've been bad-mouthing me,
haven't you?

00:33:12.846 --> 00:33:14.598
No, of course not.

00:33:16.558 --> 00:33:18.226
I know things are tough.

00:33:19.894 --> 00:33:21.479
I hope you're eating well, sir.

00:33:33.783 --> 00:33:37.245
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:33:37.329 --> 00:33:40.081
Two, two, three, four.

00:33:40.165 --> 00:33:42.751
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:33:42.834 --> 00:33:45.128
Two, two, three, four.

00:33:46.713 --> 00:33:47.589
Five.

00:33:55.764 --> 00:33:57.307
-So? Can you see it?
-Yes, sir.

00:33:58.099 --> 00:33:59.893
-Okay, shoot.
-Yes, sir.

00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:02.687
Three.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:05.649
One, two, three.

00:34:19.996 --> 00:34:20.955
Gosh.

00:34:24.584 --> 00:34:27.128
I have to go to headquarters later.

00:34:28.713 --> 00:34:30.173
I didn't ask.

00:34:31.549 --> 00:34:34.052
Managing safety,
reporting to headquarters…

00:34:35.136 --> 00:34:38.014
I'm so busy. Gosh.

00:34:38.098 --> 00:34:40.684
RECEPTION, PAYMENT

00:34:48.817 --> 00:34:51.486
FIVE SAFETY RULES
SAFETY EXERCISES, LOGISTICS CHECK

00:34:53.405 --> 00:34:54.906

FACTORY SAFETY CHECK

00:35:11.089 --> 00:35:13.341
Hello, Jeong-tae. It's me, Kim Nak-su.

00:35:14.676 --> 00:35:17.262
Are we still on for dinner tonight?

00:35:17.345 --> 00:35:19.973
Yes, I already sent you the address.

00:35:20.056 --> 00:35:21.516
Why? Did something come up?

00:35:21.599 --> 00:35:24.352
No. I was just calling to confirm.

00:35:24.436 --> 00:35:27.397
-All right, see you then.
-Oh, there's one more thing.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.941
The Logistics or Production Team here

00:35:30.024 --> 00:35:32.569
asked me for some materials
for a training session.

00:35:33.069 --> 00:35:35.947
I'll send them to you later,
so could you give me some feedback?

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:39.159
It's just that I feel
like I've lost my touch lately.

00:35:39.242 --> 00:35:40.535
So I'm not sure how I did.

00:35:40.618 --> 00:35:43.872
I know nothing about that stuff.
Would my opinion even matter?

00:35:43.955 --> 00:35:46.708
It's fine.
Could you just take a quick look?

00:35:46.791 --> 00:35:48.126
I'll send them to you later.

00:35:48.209 --> 00:35:49.836
All right, fine.

00:35:49.919 --> 00:35:52.964
I'll see you later then. Thank you.

00:36:01.222 --> 00:36:02.766
You can do this, Kim Nak-su.

00:36:06.728 --> 00:36:08.855
Does anyone have plans this evening?

00:36:12.442 --> 00:36:14.360
It's fine. You can tell me.

00:36:14.986 --> 00:36:15.987
We don't have any plans.

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:18.072
We're free too.

00:36:18.782 --> 00:36:21.659
Then how about
a Sales Team dinner tonight?

00:36:22.285 --> 00:36:24.162
-I'd love that! A team dinner!
-That's great.

00:36:24.245 --> 00:36:25.163
Sure.

00:36:25.246 --> 00:36:27.290
Should I book
that craft beer place you like?

00:36:27.373 --> 00:36:29.250
That place is nice, too, but Ms. Kwon…

00:36:29.918 --> 00:36:31.002
Yes, sir?

00:36:31.085 --> 00:36:34.339
Let's go to that spot your team
used to go to. I want to try it.

00:36:35.965 --> 00:36:36.925
All right.

00:36:37.008 --> 00:36:39.135
I'll meet you there
after my client meeting,

00:36:39.219 --> 00:36:40.178
so send me the address.

00:36:40.261 --> 00:36:41.888
-Yes, sir.
-See you all there.

00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:44.015
-We'll see you later.
-See you later, sir.

00:36:44.098 --> 00:36:45.850
-See you later.
-We'll see you later, sir.

00:37:08.039 --> 00:37:09.374
What are you doing?

00:37:12.877 --> 00:37:16.965
I have to sell this
to at least pay off the interest.

00:37:20.009 --> 00:37:21.344
SELLING COFFEE MACHINE
CONTACT ME

00:37:21.427 --> 00:37:23.096
Hey, what is this?

00:37:23.179 --> 00:37:24.973
Would you buy this
if you saw this posting?

00:37:25.056 --> 00:37:28.268
Then what? What should I do?

00:37:31.062 --> 00:37:31.980
It's this one, right?

00:37:32.063 --> 00:37:32.939
Yes.

00:37:46.661 --> 00:37:49.330
EDIT USED ITEM POST

00:37:49.414 --> 00:37:50.623
LESS THAN A YEAR OLD

00:37:53.376 --> 00:37:55.753
How do you come up with
these words so easily?

00:37:55.837 --> 00:37:58.131
I'm simply listing the facts.

00:37:59.883 --> 00:38:03.720
Adding useless details to a listing
just makes you seem untrustworthy.

00:38:08.766 --> 00:38:10.810
Is there anything else we can sell?

00:38:11.769 --> 00:38:13.605
"Professional high-end speakers."

00:38:13.688 --> 00:38:15.857
A turntable and Bluetooth.

00:38:16.357 --> 00:38:19.819
"A simple mid-century vibe…"

00:38:20.445 --> 00:38:23.156
"Mid-century"? What kind of vibe is that?

00:38:24.741 --> 00:38:26.242
Mid-century.

00:38:29.954 --> 00:38:33.041
If you also get the desk,
I'll give you both for 300,000 won.

00:38:33.958 --> 00:38:35.460
-How about 250?
-280.

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:37.837
-Then 260.
-280.

00:38:37.921 --> 00:38:38.922
Fine, 270!

00:38:41.633 --> 00:38:43.468
How about 275?

00:38:44.802 --> 00:38:46.054
That's our final offer.

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:50.600
All right! We made some money!

00:38:50.683 --> 00:38:52.644
Shipping from a convenience store
is fine too.

00:38:52.727 --> 00:38:53.853
I made sure it's well-packed.

00:38:54.729 --> 00:38:55.688
Okay.

00:38:57.649 --> 00:38:59.901
-Let's go to the convenience store.
-Let's go.

00:39:08.743 --> 00:39:10.328
Thank you.

00:39:10.411 --> 00:39:12.038
-Take care.
-Thank you.

00:39:13.247 --> 00:39:16.668
JEALOUSY, MY STRENGTH

00:39:16.751 --> 00:39:18.252
Man, I'm starving.

00:39:18.753 --> 00:39:19.963
Aren't you hungry?

00:39:20.046 --> 00:39:21.547
I am too.

00:39:21.631 --> 00:39:22.632
Let's go.

00:39:25.259 --> 00:39:26.719
I'll get the BLT.

00:39:26.803 --> 00:39:27.679
Yes.

00:39:27.762 --> 00:39:29.472
Let's eat!

00:39:33.142 --> 00:39:34.852
They say,
"Those who don't work, don't eat."

00:39:34.936 --> 00:39:38.439
It must mean that food tastes better
once you've worked for it.

00:39:38.523 --> 00:39:40.108
This bagel is so good.

00:39:40.191 --> 00:39:42.026
Should we get one more and split it?

00:39:42.777 --> 00:39:45.279
Let's just get another one each.

00:39:45.363 --> 00:39:46.948
We earned 3.8 million won today.

00:39:47.031 --> 00:39:48.866
-Yeah, let's order more.
-Let's do it.

00:39:51.327 --> 00:39:52.996
We make a good team, don't we?

00:39:57.333 --> 00:39:59.127
Han-na, since we're on a roll,

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:03.089
why don't we get some stock
and start selling for real?

00:40:03.172 --> 00:40:04.841
But with what money?

00:40:05.633 --> 00:40:07.135
I'm 30 million won in debt.

00:40:09.595 --> 00:40:11.139
I'll look for an investor.

00:40:18.521 --> 00:40:19.397
All right.

00:40:27.113 --> 00:40:28.448
Let's get going.

00:40:39.292 --> 00:40:40.251
Okay.

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.678
All right.

00:40:57.727 --> 00:40:58.811
Let's do this.

00:41:28.883 --> 00:41:31.135
I hope you are
in excellent health and spirits, sir.

00:41:31.219 --> 00:41:34.097
Your humble subordinate, Kim Nak-su,
is here to greet you.

00:41:37.225 --> 00:41:39.268
What are you doing, man? Get in here.

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:44.398
Here's a hangover drink, Jeong-tae.

00:41:44.482 --> 00:41:45.608
My gosh.

00:41:45.691 --> 00:41:47.860
And an interdental brush
for after our meal.

00:41:47.944 --> 00:41:49.153
Thanks.

00:41:50.947 --> 00:41:53.241
All right.

00:41:54.492 --> 00:41:55.576
Oh, thank you.

00:42:00.581 --> 00:42:01.707
Thank you.

00:42:01.791 --> 00:42:03.501
-Enjoy your meal.
-Yes, thank you.

00:42:04.961 --> 00:42:07.505
Here, sir. Some radish sprouts.

00:42:09.549 --> 00:42:10.800
Enjoy your meal, sir.

00:42:11.968 --> 00:42:13.010
Are you paying?

00:42:13.719 --> 00:42:15.096
Thank you for the meal.

00:42:16.848 --> 00:42:19.267
-Eat up.
-Yes. Right.

00:42:21.185 --> 00:42:22.061
Jeong-tae.

00:42:23.688 --> 00:42:26.649
I've learned a great deal
while working at the factory.

00:42:26.732 --> 00:42:29.902
It made me feel
like I wasted my time at the company.

00:42:29.986 --> 00:42:33.114
And that I failed to properly
communicate with my team members.

00:42:33.865 --> 00:42:36.409
In fact, I'm truly grateful
that you sent me there.

00:42:36.492 --> 00:42:40.037
If I hadn't gone to Asan,
I don't think I ever would have known.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:41.664
Thank you, sir.

00:42:44.125 --> 00:42:45.793
-That's a relief.
-Yes, sir.

00:42:48.713 --> 00:42:51.299
Oh, wait. Allow me.

00:42:51.799 --> 00:42:52.842
Here.

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:55.678
-Let me pour you one.
-Yes, sir.

00:42:58.723 --> 00:42:59.849
Thank you.

00:43:03.936 --> 00:43:05.229
Since it's been a while…

00:43:05.313 --> 00:43:06.272
Jeez.

00:43:11.777 --> 00:43:13.738
-Sir!
-Over here!

00:43:14.363 --> 00:43:15.656
Thank you.

00:43:16.157 --> 00:43:19.243
All right. We're not here
to just get wasted all night.

00:43:19.327 --> 00:43:20.995
Let's eat for an hour
and then head home.

00:43:21.078 --> 00:43:22.496
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:23.456
Let's dig in.

00:43:23.539 --> 00:43:24.999
-Enjoy your meal.
-Enjoy.

00:43:25.082 --> 00:43:26.083
Enjoy your meal, sir.

00:43:26.709 --> 00:43:29.921
This feels like a company dinner
from an old K-drama.

00:43:30.004 --> 00:43:31.422
You think so?

00:43:31.505 --> 00:43:33.382
Well, Mr. Kim is pretty old-fashioned.

00:43:33.466 --> 00:43:34.592
This vibe fits him perfectly.

00:43:34.675 --> 00:43:37.053
True. The age gap
between him and Mr. Do is…

00:43:37.136 --> 00:43:38.596
Hey, we're out of drinks.

00:43:39.347 --> 00:43:40.806
Where are they?

00:43:42.141 --> 00:43:44.310
I'll go get some more.

00:43:46.812 --> 00:43:49.148
I had kimchi stew here
a few times for lunch.

00:43:49.232 --> 00:43:51.609
-But it tastes different at night.
-Yes.

00:43:52.318 --> 00:43:55.196
They use a different broth for the stew
at lunch and dinner.

00:43:55.279 --> 00:43:58.074
They use rice water for lunch
and a meat broth for dinner.

00:43:58.157 --> 00:44:00.034
They say it's because
having oily broth at lunch

00:44:00.117 --> 00:44:01.452
can give you indigestion at work.

00:44:01.535 --> 00:44:03.329
I see. So they switch it up.

00:44:03.412 --> 00:44:05.206
Wow, I can't believe you noticed.

00:44:05.289 --> 00:44:06.916
You're like that too, Sung-gu.

00:44:07.583 --> 00:44:10.044
-Pardon?
-I'm saying you're flexible.

00:44:10.127 --> 00:44:11.420
Both you and the owner here.

00:44:14.048 --> 00:44:15.675
Yes. I am pretty flexible.

00:44:17.802 --> 00:44:18.970
Bottle opener.

00:44:19.053 --> 00:44:20.554
-An opener?
-Yeah.

00:44:20.638 --> 00:44:22.306
Didn't you bring one earlier?

00:44:24.183 --> 00:44:26.018
-Sorry.
-No, it's okay. I'll get it.

00:44:26.102 --> 00:44:28.020
Would you? It's over there inside.

00:44:28.688 --> 00:44:30.314
By the way, is Mr. Kim doing okay?

00:44:31.983 --> 00:44:33.109
Which Mr. Kim, sir?

00:44:33.192 --> 00:44:34.277
Mr. Kim Nak-su.

00:44:34.986 --> 00:44:36.612
You went to the Asan factory, didn't you?

00:44:36.696 --> 00:44:37.863
Yes.

00:44:37.947 --> 00:44:41.617
I lost at rock, paper, scissors,
so I had no choice!

00:44:41.701 --> 00:44:44.120
I bet you lost on purpose.
You're a very caring person.

00:44:44.203 --> 00:44:47.081
Oh no. Not at all, sir.

00:44:47.164 --> 00:44:49.792
-So this is why he gathered us here.
-Exactly.

00:44:49.875 --> 00:44:52.378
Anyway, it was a business trip,
so I was running around.

00:44:52.461 --> 00:44:55.131
I didn't even have time
for a smoke with Mr. Kim.

00:44:55.214 --> 00:44:56.924
Still, you should treat him well.

00:44:57.008 --> 00:44:59.343
You might end up working for him again.

00:45:00.344 --> 00:45:01.929
I'm not sure that would happen.

00:45:02.013 --> 00:45:04.765
You never know.
Things are always changing.

00:45:05.891 --> 00:45:09.228
If he comes back,
I'll welcome him with open arms.

00:45:09.312 --> 00:45:10.688
I still have a lot to learn.

00:45:12.356 --> 00:45:15.109
-Okay, fill your glasses. Let's drink.
-Yes, of course.

00:45:15.192 --> 00:45:17.987
-Fill your glasses, everyone!
-Okay.

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:19.530
Allow me, sir.

00:45:20.531 --> 00:45:23.784
I'm a very lucky leader
to have such excellent team members.

00:45:23.868 --> 00:45:24.785
All right, Sales Team!

00:45:24.869 --> 00:45:26.287
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

00:45:27.413 --> 00:45:28.706
Let's do this.

00:45:30.249 --> 00:45:31.292
Oh my.

00:45:32.209 --> 00:45:33.085
There's more?

00:45:34.045 --> 00:45:34.920
My goodness.

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.799
Gosh, I'm full.
I'm not sure I can eat more.

00:45:39.467 --> 00:45:42.386
It's shrimp. Your favorite.
I'm sure you have room for more.

00:45:48.726 --> 00:45:49.769
Jeong-tae,

00:45:49.852 --> 00:45:52.396
did you get a chance
to look at what I sent you?

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.397
Yes.

00:45:54.273 --> 00:45:55.149
I saw it.

00:45:55.232 --> 00:45:59.111
Well, I threw it together in a hurry.
What did you think?

00:45:59.862 --> 00:46:00.738
It was good.

00:46:01.489 --> 00:46:02.948
Ever since you were a new hire,

00:46:03.032 --> 00:46:04.950
your reports have always been neat.

00:46:05.034 --> 00:46:05.993
Oh, well…

00:46:06.077 --> 00:46:08.329
I wasn't looking for a compliment.

00:46:08.954 --> 00:46:11.290
Please let me know
if I should revise anything.

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:17.338
Are you serious?

00:46:18.339 --> 00:46:19.590
Yes, of course.

00:46:22.843 --> 00:46:26.722
What are you trying to tell me
with that report?

00:46:28.265 --> 00:46:29.141
Pardon?

00:46:29.225 --> 00:46:31.268
You wrote it for me.

00:46:31.352 --> 00:46:32.728
Didn't you?

00:46:34.772 --> 00:46:36.816
I told you already.

00:46:36.899 --> 00:46:38.359
It's for training at the factory.

00:46:38.442 --> 00:46:42.530
It's about how stability
has a positive impact on productivity--

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:45.991
Right. So what?

00:46:46.867 --> 00:46:48.828
What are you suggesting we do?

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.749
To create
a flatter organizational culture--

00:46:53.833 --> 00:46:56.252
Is creating
a flatter organizational culture

00:46:56.836 --> 00:46:58.129
your job at the factory?

00:47:01.882 --> 00:47:06.178
To be honest, I don't understand
what that report is for

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.223
or what you're trying to say with it.

00:47:09.306 --> 00:47:11.016
I have absolutely no idea.

00:47:11.684 --> 00:47:14.854
It's neatly organized,
but there's no substance.

00:47:14.937 --> 00:47:15.938
Well…

00:47:17.106 --> 00:47:18.649
I still have a lot to learn, sir.

00:47:18.732 --> 00:47:20.776
I'll take it to heart. I apologize.

00:47:22.361 --> 00:47:24.238
-Nak-su.
-Yes?

00:47:24.989 --> 00:47:26.574
I think that report

00:47:27.199 --> 00:47:29.577
says a lot about you.

00:47:31.579 --> 00:47:32.830
You punk.

00:47:34.707 --> 00:47:36.709
What you're doing isn't work.

00:47:43.799 --> 00:47:46.427
If what I'm doing isn't work,

00:47:47.178 --> 00:47:48.679
then what exactly am I doing?

00:47:48.762 --> 00:47:50.514
You're just going through the motions.

00:47:52.016 --> 00:47:54.018
Work is about responsibility.

00:47:54.101 --> 00:47:56.896
But you're not taking
any responsibility at all.

00:47:56.979 --> 00:48:00.399
No. You don't even know how.

00:48:02.776 --> 00:48:05.029
I was sent all the way to the factory,

00:48:05.112 --> 00:48:07.406
and I don't know
how to take responsibility?

00:48:10.409 --> 00:48:13.913
You really haven't changed one bit.

00:48:14.914 --> 00:48:19.293
You were always
a really great team member,

00:48:20.044 --> 00:48:21.212
but in the end,

00:48:22.046 --> 00:48:24.632
I guess you just couldn't be
a good leader.

00:48:37.353 --> 00:48:38.854
-Nak-su.
-Wait, Jeong-tae.

00:48:40.147 --> 00:48:43.817
Did you call me all the way out here
just to say things like that?

00:48:43.901 --> 00:48:47.738
I'm only saying this because I care,
and I'm worried about you.

00:48:47.821 --> 00:48:49.615
Because you care and are worried about me?

00:48:52.326 --> 00:48:56.205
Right. Anyway, the reason
I called you here today--

00:48:56.288 --> 00:48:57.414
No.

00:48:58.415 --> 00:49:00.292
Do you even have the right
to worry about me?

00:49:00.376 --> 00:49:01.544
What?

00:49:01.627 --> 00:49:04.088
You were the one
who drove me into this hell.

00:49:04.171 --> 00:49:07.591
I mean, what kind of perpetrator
worries about their victim?

00:49:07.675 --> 00:49:10.052
-Nak-su, you really--
-I'm not working?

00:49:10.135 --> 00:49:12.638
Then what the hell have I been doing
for the past 25 years?

00:49:12.721 --> 00:49:14.598
You really just don't get it, do you?

00:49:14.682 --> 00:49:16.475
You're right. I guess I don't.

00:49:16.559 --> 00:49:19.228
That's why I'm cleaning up dog poop
in some factory at my age.

00:49:19.311 --> 00:49:21.438
Right. That's the perfect job
for you, punk.

00:49:21.522 --> 00:49:23.774
I was going through the motions?

00:49:24.441 --> 00:49:27.444
Then what about washing
your underwear and socks?

00:49:27.528 --> 00:49:28.696
Does that not count as work?

00:49:28.779 --> 00:49:29.863
What are you talking about?

00:49:29.947 --> 00:49:32.241
If you ask your teammates
to do that now, you'd get sued.

00:49:32.324 --> 00:49:34.118
When did I ask you to wash my underwear?

00:49:34.201 --> 00:49:36.287
Go ahead and sue me then!

00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:38.998
You never worked
with the younger staff. But I did.

00:49:39.081 --> 00:49:41.542
I was stuck between you and the others,

00:49:41.625 --> 00:49:43.502
trying to please both sides!

00:49:44.169 --> 00:49:47.089
That's how I got you this far!
And this is what you say to me?

00:49:47.172 --> 00:49:48.966
What about you, then?

00:49:49.466 --> 00:49:51.218
Who do you think helped you keep your job?

00:49:51.302 --> 00:49:52.469
Are you saying it's you?

00:49:52.553 --> 00:49:55.806
Of course it is, you idiot!
You could've been fired straight away!

00:49:55.889 --> 00:49:58.267
I'm the one who fought like hell
to defend you!

00:49:58.809 --> 00:50:02.104
The Asan transfer was the end of it
because of me! Got that?

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.327
You jerk.

00:50:17.745 --> 00:50:19.913
So that's what happened. I had no idea.

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:22.708
I really had no idea at all.

00:50:24.209 --> 00:50:27.421
I thought it was because Do Jin-woo
is more useful to you than I am.

00:50:27.504 --> 00:50:30.466
And since I know all of your shady past,

00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:33.177
you felt uneasy having me around.

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:36.055
So I thought you seized the chance
to finally cut me loose.

00:50:36.138 --> 00:50:38.015
But that was your grand plan.

00:50:38.098 --> 00:50:39.475
Wow!

00:50:39.558 --> 00:50:41.977
Brilliant, Baek Jeong-tae.

00:50:43.103 --> 00:50:44.813
You asshole.

00:50:44.897 --> 00:50:46.523
What, you think you're a good leader?

00:50:46.607 --> 00:50:49.026
You toss aside your junior,
who washed your underwear

00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:50.069
and cleaned up your mess,

00:50:50.152 --> 00:50:52.613
then pretend to be all generous.
Is that a good leader?

00:50:52.696 --> 00:50:54.490
You son of a bitch.

00:50:56.617 --> 00:50:58.535
The worst thing that happened to me

00:51:00.412 --> 00:51:01.872
was having you as my senior.

00:51:02.831 --> 00:51:05.250
When you get fired someday,
I'll say the same thing to you.

00:51:05.334 --> 00:51:09.046
"I think you were just going through
the motions as an executive."

00:51:09.129 --> 00:51:11.215
You son of a bitch. How dare you!

00:51:11.298 --> 00:51:12.257
-What?
-You asshole!

00:51:12.341 --> 00:51:14.176
After everything I did for you,
how could you?

00:51:14.259 --> 00:51:16.345
I didn't do any work? Me?

00:51:16.428 --> 00:51:18.806
-Hey!
-You son of a bitch.

00:51:18.889 --> 00:51:19.932
Going through the motions?

00:51:20.015 --> 00:51:21.934
-Did you work, then?
-How can you say that?

00:51:22.017 --> 00:51:23.686
You were always out playing fucking golf!

00:51:23.769 --> 00:51:26.230
-Hey! After everything I've done for you!
-Damn it!

00:51:26.313 --> 00:51:28.732
You of all people can't do this to me,
you bastard!

00:51:28.816 --> 00:51:30.150
Why can't I? You bastard!

00:51:30.234 --> 00:51:32.236
-"Bastard"?
-You're worse than…

00:51:34.613 --> 00:51:36.281
-What's going on here?
-You really are…

00:52:24.163 --> 00:52:25.289
I really messed up.

00:52:26.165 --> 00:52:28.250
But I feel strangely calm,

00:52:29.001 --> 00:52:30.210
and my head is clear.

00:52:31.336 --> 00:52:32.755
Is it because

00:52:34.006 --> 00:52:36.800
the uncertainty is gone,
regardless of the outcome?

00:52:38.844 --> 00:52:40.554
Ha-jin, I'm sorry.

00:52:43.599 --> 00:52:45.058
I guess this is it for me.

00:52:53.192 --> 00:52:54.943
They say it's really delicious.

00:52:56.528 --> 00:52:57.446
Hello.

00:52:59.323 --> 00:53:01.241
I need to put on more sunscreen.

00:53:01.325 --> 00:53:02.326
I brought some.

00:53:02.409 --> 00:53:03.994
-Hey.
-Hello.

00:53:04.077 --> 00:53:05.496
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:53:08.165 --> 00:53:09.208
-Let's go!
-Let's do this.

00:53:09.333 --> 00:53:11.418
-All right. Let's go.
-Let's go!

00:53:11.502 --> 00:53:13.045
Everybody, shake it

00:53:13.128 --> 00:53:14.755
-Shake to the left!
-Shake to the left!

00:53:14.838 --> 00:53:17.174
-Shake to the right, up and down
-Shake it

00:53:35.275 --> 00:53:37.528
It must be urgent
for him to come on the weekend.

00:53:43.116 --> 00:53:45.202
-Hello, sir.
-You could've just called.

00:53:47.788 --> 00:53:48.997
Oh my…

00:53:49.623 --> 00:53:51.542
It looks like you've been through a lot.

00:53:53.585 --> 00:53:54.878
Well, let's head inside.

00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:56.380
Sure.

00:53:59.216 --> 00:54:01.134
Wow, it's been a while.

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.595
This place has really changed.

00:54:04.221 --> 00:54:06.765
You could've just called.
Why come all the way out here?

00:54:06.849 --> 00:54:07.975
On a weekend, no less.

00:54:09.309 --> 00:54:10.936
I didn't want to come, either.

00:54:12.437 --> 00:54:13.730
Mr. Kim.

00:54:13.814 --> 00:54:14.982
Yes?

00:54:15.607 --> 00:54:18.151
You should have heard Baek Jeong-tae out.

00:54:20.737 --> 00:54:22.823
I told him I'd tell you,

00:54:22.906 --> 00:54:25.993
but he insisted on doing it himself
and set up that meeting.

00:54:26.618 --> 00:54:28.912
But you two didn't even get
to the main point.

00:54:28.996 --> 00:54:30.372
My gosh.

00:54:32.249 --> 00:54:33.709
So what was the main point?

00:54:37.212 --> 00:54:38.088
Right.

00:54:38.797 --> 00:54:40.716
Let me explain.

00:54:41.216 --> 00:54:45.637
ACT has decided to downsize its workforce.

00:54:47.723 --> 00:54:50.475
That goes for the staff
at headquarters, of course.

00:54:50.559 --> 00:54:54.646
And the Asan factory
also needs to be restructured.

00:54:55.355 --> 00:54:56.690
So, about that…

00:55:01.069 --> 00:55:02.362
We need your help, sir.

00:55:05.866 --> 00:55:07.284
-Me?
-Yes.

00:55:09.286 --> 00:55:11.705
I'm just on the Safety Management Team.

00:55:13.373 --> 00:55:15.292
The HR Team here

00:55:15.375 --> 00:55:18.879
is in cahoots with the Production Team,
so they won't listen to us.

00:55:18.962 --> 00:55:21.298
The only person
I can ask for help with this

00:55:22.382 --> 00:55:23.592
is you, sir.

00:55:24.384 --> 00:55:25.844
What am I supposed to do, exactly?

00:55:25.928 --> 00:55:29.306
Well, if safety management violations
start to accumulate,

00:55:29.389 --> 00:55:32.184
we can use that as grounds
to pressure them to resign.

00:55:32.267 --> 00:55:35.312
It's a method we've used here before.

00:55:35.395 --> 00:55:36.396
Sir.

00:55:38.482 --> 00:55:39.775
Just 20 people.

00:55:41.318 --> 00:55:43.278
Please draw up a list by next week.

00:55:45.614 --> 00:55:49.284
When headquarters gives you an assignment,

00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:51.995
tackle it head-on.

00:55:53.747 --> 00:55:55.374
If this goes well,

00:55:55.457 --> 00:55:57.292
you won't need Baek Jeong-tae.

00:55:57.376 --> 00:55:59.211
I'll make sure you get back to HQ.

00:55:59.294 --> 00:56:01.797
It must've been tough
sucking up to Baek Jeong-tae.

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:03.173
No?

00:56:03.256 --> 00:56:05.133
Use this opportunity
to get on my good side.

00:56:14.434 --> 00:56:15.602
Oh, and…

00:56:19.690 --> 00:56:20.941
Here, Mr. Kim.

00:56:25.278 --> 00:56:27.781
VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT PROGRAM

00:56:30.242 --> 00:56:33.036
Don't get the wrong idea.
The notice will be up on Monday.

00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:35.998
I'm just giving this to you now,
so you can look it over.

00:56:36.623 --> 00:56:39.376
Well, I can't help it
even if you take it the wrong way.

00:56:41.336 --> 00:56:43.213
I'll get going now, sir.

00:56:43.296 --> 00:56:44.631
Take care.

00:56:44.715 --> 00:56:46.883
Make sure you read it carefully.

00:57:35.682 --> 00:57:36.975
Hello.

00:57:37.893 --> 00:57:39.186
Hello.

00:57:39.811 --> 00:57:41.104
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:57:41.855 --> 00:57:43.315
Good morning.

00:57:52.532 --> 00:57:54.117
Six, seven, back exercise.

00:57:54.201 --> 00:57:56.787
One, two, three, four.

00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:59.664
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:57:59.748 --> 00:58:05.378
Two, two, three, four.
Five, six, seven, walk.

00:58:05.462 --> 00:58:07.464
One, two, three, four.

00:58:08.173 --> 00:58:09.591
Five, six.

00:58:10.217 --> 00:58:11.218
Do it properly.

00:58:12.177 --> 00:58:14.721
Three, four, five, six,

00:58:14.805 --> 00:58:16.306
seven, eight.

00:58:16.389 --> 00:58:18.558
One, two, three…

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:27.567
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:58:27.651 --> 00:58:28.693
One, two.

00:58:30.153 --> 00:58:31.988
Do the safety exercises properly.

00:58:33.115 --> 00:58:33.990
Two.

00:58:36.118 --> 00:58:38.495
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:58:38.578 --> 00:58:41.206
One, two, three, four,

00:58:41.289 --> 00:58:44.084
five, six, seven, eight.

00:58:44.167 --> 00:58:46.878
Two, two, three, four.

00:58:49.756 --> 00:58:52.134
One, two, three, four,

00:58:52.217 --> 00:58:54.636
five, six, seven.

00:59:05.313 --> 00:59:08.108
Do the safety exercises properly!

00:59:22.038 --> 00:59:26.960
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

00:59:57.449 --> 00:59:59.784
A ladder with no work platform
is a safety rule violation.

00:59:59.868 --> 01:00:01.703
I said to clean up!

01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:05.874
I've been hearing whispers
about Mr. Kim coming back.

01:00:05.957 --> 01:00:07.292
Why would Mr. Kim make that list?

01:00:07.375 --> 01:00:08.251
VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT

01:00:08.335 --> 01:00:10.462
You've never given a damn
about the factory.

01:00:10.545 --> 01:00:12.797
-What's with the sudden change?
-I'm just doing my job.

01:00:12.881 --> 01:00:14.257
SAFETY VIOLATIONS

01:00:14.341 --> 01:00:16.301
Would writing up that list
bring him back to HQ?

01:00:16.384 --> 01:00:18.303
You might as well be the errand boy.

01:00:18.386 --> 01:00:20.100
-What else would you do?
-You little bastard.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.390
Let's do some work.
Leave if you don't want to.

01:00:22.474 --> 01:00:23.600
Hello, Mr. Kim.

01:00:23.683 --> 01:00:26.519
And try to hang on to your job
for as long as you can.

01:00:26.603 --> 01:00:28.021
That's what being a parent is.

01:00:28.104 --> 01:00:30.315
Come to headquarters
and bring your report.

01:00:30.398 --> 01:00:31.816
You call this "work"?

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:33.860
And no matter how I look at it…

01:00:34.945 --> 01:00:36.947
it doesn't feel like work.

01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:39.032
