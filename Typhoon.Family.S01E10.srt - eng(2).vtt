TYPHOON FAMILY

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.737
What on earth?

00:01:29.027 --> 00:01:30.737
Mr. Arthit.

00:01:34.073 --> 00:01:36.951
He's the customs officer
who took the $50 bribe.

00:01:41.456 --> 00:01:43.875
"At 6:00 p.m. on April 27th,

00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.961
a Korean man gave me $10,000
after work on my way home."

00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:48.838
That's that line.

00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:56.471
Yes, he did it.

00:02:04.896 --> 00:02:06.064
Your Honor.

00:02:06.147 --> 00:02:10.777
This film includes the entire instance
of grabbing money and handing it to him.

00:02:12.737 --> 00:02:15.740
I wish to turn this film in as evidence.

00:02:24.624 --> 00:02:29.796
And if necessary, I'd like to have
the photo studio owner as our witness.

00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:51.067
-It's game over.
-Yes, it's game over.

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:09.669
RECEIPT OF THE CRIMINAL COURT

00:03:09.752 --> 00:03:11.170
FINE PAID IN FULL
DEFENDANT RELEASED

00:03:17.593 --> 00:03:18.803
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:03:18.886 --> 00:03:20.304
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:03:23.016 --> 00:03:25.226
-Are you sure it's done?
-Yes, it's done.

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:28.813
-We did it!
-We did it!

00:03:28.896 --> 00:03:29.814
We did it!

00:03:31.816 --> 00:03:33.818
-Great work.
-Yes, great work.

00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:35.570
We did it.

00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:38.656
Oh, right. Here.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.159
The old man at the photo studio
gave this back.

00:03:41.242 --> 00:03:42.577
Your watch.

00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:44.120
I'll take that.

00:03:49.042 --> 00:03:51.085
We have to hurry.

00:03:54.714 --> 00:03:58.634
COURT FOR CONCILIATION

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:01.971
-Mr. Kang. Ms. Oh.
-Hey.

00:04:02.055 --> 00:04:03.598
-Mr. Go!
-Mr. Go!

00:04:03.681 --> 00:04:08.895
-You've gone through so much trouble!
-You almost ended up in prison!

00:04:08.978 --> 00:04:11.314
Who's the police chief? Get him here!

00:04:11.397 --> 00:04:14.650
I'll show him the terror
of the Korean Marine Corps!

00:04:14.734 --> 00:04:17.111
-Hold yourself back.
-I'll hold myself back.

00:04:17.195 --> 00:04:18.529
Gosh, I'm free.

00:04:18.613 --> 00:04:20.782
-You are.
-I'm free!

00:04:20.865 --> 00:04:24.577
-I've been freed!
-You've been freed!

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.496
I got freed!

00:04:26.579 --> 00:04:28.289
-I'm free now!
-Wait.

00:04:28.373 --> 00:04:29.916
Wait, what time is it?

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:31.417
-Why?
-It's already past 3:00 p.m.!

00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:33.419
-The time! We have to go!
-We have to hurry.

00:04:33.503 --> 00:04:34.629
What do you mean?

00:04:34.712 --> 00:04:37.882
Our helmets will be disposed of
if this case isn't closed by 4:00.

00:04:37.965 --> 00:04:40.676
Why are you here?
Why were you celebrating?

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.305
We ran around everywhere
trying our best to save you!

00:04:46.474 --> 00:04:48.643
-Over there. That's the car.
-Hey!

00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:50.019
-Over here!
-Here!

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:54.524
-Get in.
-To the port!

00:04:54.607 --> 00:04:56.067
-No, you can't go!
-Why not?

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.069
-Why not?
-We're in huge trouble!

00:04:58.152 --> 00:04:59.153
What now?

00:04:59.237 --> 00:05:01.864
They're doing some construction work
on the highway,

00:05:01.948 --> 00:05:04.534
so the entire road is closed off!

00:05:06.411 --> 00:05:09.122
This car can't go on the highway.
We can't go.

00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:11.666
If we can't take this car,
we'll take another way, then.

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:13.960
Goodness gracious.

00:05:14.043 --> 00:05:17.505
It'll take at least an hour
to get to the port.

00:05:17.588 --> 00:05:20.550
And there's no guarantee
that other roads will be open.

00:05:20.633 --> 00:05:22.927
-What do we do?
-What now?

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.721
-Let's find bicycles.
-How are you going to go on bicycles?

00:05:25.805 --> 00:05:27.390
What else can we do, then?

00:05:27.473 --> 00:05:29.600
I get scared. I'm not going!

00:05:30.393 --> 00:05:32.228
Where are you going, Mr. Go?

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.647
-Where is he going?
-Where are you going?

00:05:43.322 --> 00:05:44.407
What's going on?

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.576
What are you doing, Mr. Go?

00:05:47.785 --> 00:05:50.913
When in doubt, always take a motorcycle.

00:05:50.997 --> 00:05:52.081
-Let's go, Ms. Oh.
-Okay.

00:05:52.165 --> 00:05:54.208
I'll get behind you,
and Ms. Oh can hop on last.

00:05:54.292 --> 00:05:55.626
You can come separately.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:56.961
Why?

00:05:57.044 --> 00:05:59.380
This motorcycle can't fit three.
We aren't kids, you know.

00:05:59.463 --> 00:06:01.174
The sales team will go on our own.

00:06:03.342 --> 00:06:05.678
-Bye.
-Hold tight!

00:06:06.262 --> 00:06:07.513
Be careful!

00:06:13.394 --> 00:06:17.356
MIN BURI CRIMINAL COURT
MIN BURI CIVIL COURT

00:06:18.065 --> 00:06:19.108
What about me?

00:06:32.496 --> 00:06:33.915
Thank you, Ms. Oh!

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.375
What? I can't hear you!

00:06:38.044 --> 00:06:39.462
Hold tight!

00:06:39.545 --> 00:06:41.505
I can't hear you, Mr. Go!

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:44.467
-And you smell awful!
-What?

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.594
You smell awful!

00:06:46.677 --> 00:06:48.304
Don't worry!

00:06:48.387 --> 00:06:51.224
We need to hurry, but be careful!

00:07:01.776 --> 00:07:03.402
Let me come through!

00:07:12.078 --> 00:07:13.454
Excuse me!

00:07:23.798 --> 00:07:25.550
Coming through!

00:07:25.633 --> 00:07:26.759
I'm sorry!

00:07:37.144 --> 00:07:40.856
-Drive faster, Mr. Go!
-This motorcycle is too slow!

00:07:42.191 --> 00:07:44.527
-Do you know the direction?
-Trust me!

00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:47.405
-Just trust in me!
-Eyes on the road!

00:08:32.491 --> 00:08:33.576
Be careful, Mr. Go.

00:08:35.578 --> 00:08:36.704
Don't worry!

00:08:42.418 --> 00:08:45.212
You're going too fast!

00:08:46.422 --> 00:08:48.382
Don't worry about it!

00:08:55.348 --> 00:08:58.225
-What's going on? What is it?
-Wait a second.

00:08:58.309 --> 00:08:59.727
-What's with this?
-What?

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.855
-This can't happen. What's going on?
-Is it broken? Why?

00:09:02.938 --> 00:09:04.190
Why? What's the matter?

00:09:04.273 --> 00:09:06.400
-It won't move.
-Did it break down?

00:09:06.484 --> 00:09:08.277
-What's with this?
-What are we going to do?

00:09:08.361 --> 00:09:10.780
-Why would it break down now?
-We should do something.

00:09:10.863 --> 00:09:12.657
We'll do something. But…

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.909
-This is driving me insane.
-Wait, what do we do?

00:09:14.992 --> 00:09:16.410
What now? Wait.

00:09:16.994 --> 00:09:18.454
-Let's see.
-Darn it.

00:09:18.537 --> 00:09:22.041
-Has the engine given up?
-Can you even tell by looking?

00:09:22.124 --> 00:09:25.002
What would I know even if I looked?
I don't know anything.

00:09:25.086 --> 00:09:27.421
But we have to do something…

00:09:28.589 --> 00:09:32.385
Hey, what's… What's with this?

00:09:32.468 --> 00:09:35.346
-Mr. Go, I'll get there faster if I run.
-What?

00:09:35.429 --> 00:09:36.847
Where are you going?

00:09:36.931 --> 00:09:39.266
Ms. Oh!

00:10:08.838 --> 00:10:09.880
Hey.

00:10:10.798 --> 00:10:11.924
Hop in.

00:10:12.842 --> 00:10:14.593
It's you, Mr. Kang.

00:10:23.477 --> 00:10:25.855
Mi-seon has gone far.
I don't see her anymore.

00:10:25.938 --> 00:10:28.107
-Did she run?
-Yes.

00:10:29.191 --> 00:10:30.359
Why would she do that?

00:11:04.143 --> 00:11:05.394
PRIVATE CAR LANE

00:11:09.231 --> 00:11:11.108
Okay, just trust me.

00:11:16.572 --> 00:11:17.448
Ms. Oh!

00:11:53.108 --> 00:11:54.777
Oh, no…

00:12:05.454 --> 00:12:07.414
Wait! Wait a moment!

00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.709
Hold on! Wait, no. Wait.

00:12:10.793 --> 00:12:12.503
-Get out.
-I'm begging you. Please.

00:12:12.586 --> 00:12:14.255
-Wait! Stop!
-Get out.

00:12:14.338 --> 00:12:16.215
-They're almost here.
-Get out. It's dangerous.

00:12:16.298 --> 00:12:17.508
-Hurry up!
-It's dangerous.

00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:19.385
-Let's get going.
-Get out. It's dangerous.

00:12:19.468 --> 00:12:20.761
-One moment.
-Hurry up, quick!

00:12:20.844 --> 00:12:22.012
Wait just a little.

00:12:22.096 --> 00:12:24.682
-They're almost here.
-It's dangerous.

00:12:24.765 --> 00:12:27.017
-Please…
-What's she saying? One minute!

00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:29.687
-No, wait.
-Hey!

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:30.896
Jeez.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.106
-Get down.
-Get out.

00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:33.649
-Get down.
-Get out. It's dangerous.

00:12:33.732 --> 00:12:35.442
-No, stop!
-Get out.

00:12:35.526 --> 00:12:37.444
-Ten minutes! Stop, please.
-Get out.

00:12:37.528 --> 00:12:39.572
-Ten minutes. Ten minutes.
-Get her out of here.

00:12:39.655 --> 00:12:41.365
-You can't. Wait…
-Get out.

00:12:41.448 --> 00:12:44.827
-No, wait! They're almost here!
-Get out.

00:12:52.042 --> 00:12:53.043
Wait!

00:12:54.628 --> 00:12:56.505
You can't! No!

00:12:57.172 --> 00:12:58.424
I won't let you.

00:13:00.009 --> 00:13:01.135
No, wait!

00:13:10.394 --> 00:13:11.645
Please…

00:13:26.035 --> 00:13:27.286
Ms. Oh!

00:13:31.749 --> 00:13:33.584
No…

00:13:33.667 --> 00:13:35.794
-Hold tight, Mr. Go!
-What?

00:13:42.176 --> 00:13:43.636
-Move!
-Move aside!

00:13:43.719 --> 00:13:45.387
-Move aside!
-Move aside!

00:13:45.471 --> 00:13:47.723
Move aside, all of you!

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.601
-Ms. Oh! Move aside!
-Move aside!

00:13:50.684 --> 00:13:52.144
-Ms. Oh!
-Move it!

00:13:54.355 --> 00:13:56.190
No…

00:14:09.203 --> 00:14:10.454
Move aside!

00:14:16.919 --> 00:14:18.379
-Mi-seon!
-Move aside!

00:14:35.604 --> 00:14:36.689
Are you okay, Mr. Go?

00:14:37.314 --> 00:14:38.607
I'm fine.

00:14:38.691 --> 00:14:40.609
No, I'm not fine!

00:14:43.362 --> 00:14:45.155
Stop it!

00:14:53.664 --> 00:14:55.165
Get out.

00:14:55.249 --> 00:14:57.751
Mr. Kang, are you all right?

00:14:57.835 --> 00:14:58.919
I'm fine.

00:14:59.003 --> 00:15:00.379
-Here.
-Yes.

00:15:00.462 --> 00:15:01.755
Take it.

00:15:03.465 --> 00:15:05.134
What? Get out of the way!

00:15:05.217 --> 00:15:06.593
I have it. Hold on.

00:15:07.511 --> 00:15:08.721
Here.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.519
FINE PAID IN FULL PER VERDICT
DEFENDANT DISCHARGED

00:15:16.145 --> 00:15:17.521
Oh, I see.

00:15:27.197 --> 00:15:30.284
What's going on? The tuktuk! Hold it.

00:15:32.161 --> 00:15:34.121
-That was so shocking.
-It worked.

00:15:34.204 --> 00:15:35.831
-Hey, your forehead.
-What about it?

00:15:35.914 --> 00:15:36.874
You're bleeding.

00:15:36.957 --> 00:15:38.083
-I'm bleeding?
-Oh, no.

00:15:38.167 --> 00:15:39.168
I'm fine.

00:15:41.545 --> 00:15:44.173
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-No, it's okay.

00:15:44.256 --> 00:15:45.883
Are you really okay?

00:15:45.966 --> 00:15:49.720
-Are you okay, Mr. Go?
-I'm not, but I guess I'm fine.

00:16:18.832 --> 00:16:20.584
Thank you.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.801
They look like they've seen better days,
but they should be fine, right?

00:16:28.884 --> 00:16:30.427
After all, these are helmets.

00:16:35.349 --> 00:16:36.558
They look fine.

00:16:39.603 --> 00:16:40.646
The insides are destroyed.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.131
They'll run it through customs again.

00:17:09.049 --> 00:17:11.135
What's wrong? What is it?

00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:20.978
What happened to these?

00:17:22.271 --> 00:17:23.981
Are they all in this condition?

00:17:25.524 --> 00:17:28.485
Wait. Hold on.

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:29.862
I'm sure some are…

00:17:31.113 --> 00:17:33.782
Do we have to throw out all of these?

00:17:35.576 --> 00:17:36.577
What about this one?

00:17:37.286 --> 00:17:38.787
Are they all like this?

00:17:38.871 --> 00:17:41.582
Wait a second. What do we do now?

00:17:41.665 --> 00:17:44.251
What do we do?
Do we have to throw them out or what?

00:17:44.334 --> 00:17:45.711
What do we do?

00:17:50.299 --> 00:17:51.550
No, we…

00:17:53.468 --> 00:17:54.469
Wait.

00:17:55.262 --> 00:17:57.764
-Ms. Oh.
-No, wait.

00:17:59.224 --> 00:18:02.144
-It's okay. We can start again.
-No, give me a second.

00:18:14.323 --> 00:18:15.908
Wait, Mr. Kang.

00:18:16.867 --> 00:18:20.370
In the end, we failed.

00:18:21.747 --> 00:18:25.792
We couldn't find a client,
make sales, or save the inventory.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.254
Don't worry. It's okay.

00:18:30.797 --> 00:18:31.757
Ms. Oh.

00:18:32.925 --> 00:18:35.510
Ms. Oh, it's okay.

00:18:35.594 --> 00:18:38.138
We did our best.

00:18:39.097 --> 00:18:42.768
I never realized it before,
but you're very good at your job.

00:18:44.228 --> 00:18:45.896
You've done so well, Ms. Oh.

00:18:47.564 --> 00:18:49.024
Senior Staff Oh Mi-seon,

00:18:50.359 --> 00:18:51.902
you were the best trader.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.198
You've done well. It's all right.

00:18:57.991 --> 00:19:00.535
-You did a good job.
-What do we do?

00:19:01.411 --> 00:19:04.456
You did well. We can do it over.

00:19:05.999 --> 00:19:08.585
I'm so frustrated. What do we do?

00:19:12.172 --> 00:19:13.131
I'm so frustrated.

00:19:20.931 --> 00:19:22.849
I smell, don't I?

00:19:24.268 --> 00:19:25.394
You don't.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:27.354
What do we do?

00:19:45.038 --> 00:19:46.331
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:19:52.087 --> 00:19:54.172
But still, I'm so relieved.

00:19:54.256 --> 00:19:57.676
In the end, we didn't lose everything.

00:19:57.759 --> 00:20:00.554
We still managed to save 140 helmets.

00:20:01.221 --> 00:20:04.182
It came through customs,
so we won't face more problems, right?

00:20:04.266 --> 00:20:06.852
We'll do our best
to sell everything we have.

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:10.605
YEOPJIP RAMYEON

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:14.484
Should we export ramyeon?

00:20:14.568 --> 00:20:17.487
Isn't it too spicy for foreigners?

00:20:17.571 --> 00:20:20.490
The spiciness makes it unique.
I think it'll be a hit.

00:20:21.074 --> 00:20:24.119
We were going to throw away
that T-shirt, remember?

00:20:25.704 --> 00:20:27.914
Why would you throw away
this perfectly good T-shirt?

00:20:27.998 --> 00:20:34.171
This is proof
of my youthful days when I was 27.

00:20:34.254 --> 00:20:37.424
It takes me back
to the sentiment from those days,

00:20:37.507 --> 00:20:39.718
when I listened
to Deulgukhwa and Infinite Track.

00:20:39.801 --> 00:20:41.470
Were you in high school?

00:20:41.553 --> 00:20:44.848
I was in eighth grade,
and I loved Lee Sang-eun's "Dam-Da-Di."

00:20:44.931 --> 00:20:48.643
Our age gap is way too big
for us to sit together.

00:20:49.895 --> 00:20:51.730
Back in the day,

00:20:52.481 --> 00:20:55.650
when I was in tenth grade,
Nam-mo and I skipped military drill,

00:20:55.734 --> 00:20:58.028
went to watch
Kim Soo-nyung's archery game,

00:20:58.111 --> 00:21:01.531
got caught by the drill instructor,
and got beaten up ten times.

00:21:01.615 --> 00:21:03.450
That's why I have a huge butt.

00:21:04.951 --> 00:21:06.870
The student military drill?

00:21:06.953 --> 00:21:09.664
You must've practiced
with wooden guns, right?

00:21:09.748 --> 00:21:11.750
We did it with real guns.

00:21:11.833 --> 00:21:15.087
When did you start elementary school?
You're old.

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:16.421
I mean, real guns?

00:21:18.298 --> 00:21:19.591
It was a turbulent time.

00:21:20.342 --> 00:21:22.761
Everything and everyone was suspicious.

00:21:24.554 --> 00:21:25.389
However…

00:21:26.556 --> 00:21:27.724
You know,

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:34.856
just because I'm older,
it doesn't mean I'm wiser.

00:21:36.108 --> 00:21:39.903
Who would've known I'd make
such huge trouble in this foreign land?

00:21:40.612 --> 00:21:45.158
And I acted like I was full of myself
when I talked to Ms. Oh.

00:21:46.618 --> 00:21:49.496
Those $50 were just 70,000 won.

00:21:50.497 --> 00:21:54.459
I thought it was petty money,
but it led me to lose a huge amount.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:59.589
The fine seemed pretty heavy.
I'll do something to pay that back.

00:21:59.673 --> 00:22:01.925
Don't mention it.

00:22:02.008 --> 00:22:04.344
Everything happened
while you were working,

00:22:05.387 --> 00:22:06.555
so we'll write it off.

00:22:07.139 --> 00:22:11.184
But we have to pay for this business trip
and pay off Kangseong Helmet's balance.

00:22:11.268 --> 00:22:13.937
I already came up with a plan in my head.

00:22:18.024 --> 00:22:20.569
I feel too ashamed.

00:22:22.195 --> 00:22:23.029
I'm sorry.

00:22:23.655 --> 00:22:24.531
Goodness.

00:22:27.993 --> 00:22:28.910
Mr. Go.

00:22:29.494 --> 00:22:33.790
I was the one who turned off the lights
whenever you were in the restroom.

00:22:33.874 --> 00:22:34.708
I'm sorry.

00:22:36.668 --> 00:22:37.961
-So, it was you.
-Yes.

00:22:38.461 --> 00:22:42.632
I think this is really great.
I finally feel like we're a team.

00:22:44.301 --> 00:22:49.264
All right, from now on,
let us stand hand in hand.

00:22:49.347 --> 00:22:54.477
-We'll get past walls and stay as a team.
-Okay.

00:22:54.561 --> 00:22:56.062
-All right.
-Let's go!

00:22:56.146 --> 00:22:58.899
You're starting to sound like a real CEO.

00:22:59.774 --> 00:23:01.067
Of course, I am.

00:23:04.237 --> 00:23:06.740
Wait, you two
couldn't eat cilantro before.

00:23:08.033 --> 00:23:09.201
Hand in hand we stand.

00:23:31.806 --> 00:23:33.600
Come on. I'm really fine.

00:23:34.643 --> 00:23:36.978
That wound can leave a scar.

00:23:43.818 --> 00:23:45.946
-It stings.
-Hang on a second.

00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:46.988
Oh, no.

00:23:57.791 --> 00:23:59.668
Okay. All done.

00:24:01.211 --> 00:24:02.629
Does it still sting?

00:24:03.755 --> 00:24:07.842
It kind of stings,
but it kind of doesn't. I'm not sure.

00:24:08.969 --> 00:24:11.096
Someone told me not
to get up close and personal.

00:24:19.604 --> 00:24:22.023
Please excuse me, then. Get a good rest.

00:24:22.816 --> 00:24:23.817
Ms. Oh.

00:24:28.613 --> 00:24:29.906
I have something to tell you.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:34.035
-Thank you.
-What?

00:24:34.703 --> 00:24:37.038
I thought about it
and realized I never said this.

00:24:38.832 --> 00:24:40.208
When I was in trouble

00:24:40.917 --> 00:24:45.338
or when I felt I was all alone,

00:24:46.006 --> 00:24:47.799
you were always there with me.

00:24:54.306 --> 00:24:56.766
Thank you, Ms. Oh Mi-seon.

00:25:26.629 --> 00:25:29.841
I was just doing my job,

00:25:30.675 --> 00:25:31.968
whenever I had to do it.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.599
Because you have to write
the business trip log?

00:25:38.266 --> 00:25:40.393
Because records last longer than memories.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:44.147
We'll need to take
disciplinary action too.

00:26:09.381 --> 00:26:10.382
No.

00:26:13.218 --> 00:26:14.844
I prefer memories over records.

00:26:51.172 --> 00:26:57.137
EPISODE 10
YOU AND I

00:27:05.812 --> 00:27:07.981
I'll miss this so much once we go back.

00:27:08.648 --> 00:27:09.941
-Eat up.
-Okay.

00:27:10.024 --> 00:27:11.860
Does anyone sell this in Korea?

00:27:11.943 --> 00:27:14.988
-I doubt it.
-No way. That's just ridiculous.

00:27:19.534 --> 00:27:21.161
What's this red thing?

00:27:21.244 --> 00:27:23.663
Put it in the front and back.

00:27:24.914 --> 00:27:27.709
-Go Ma-jin!
-Hey.

00:27:27.792 --> 00:27:29.752
-He's here.
-Yes.

00:27:35.175 --> 00:27:36.926
-Hey, Ma-jin.
-Hey.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:38.052
Hello.

00:27:38.136 --> 00:27:40.430
-Get the boat closer.
-Pull it.

00:27:40.513 --> 00:27:41.806
-Closer.
-Right here.

00:27:43.183 --> 00:27:44.642
-Hey, Ma-jin.
-Hey.

00:27:44.726 --> 00:27:45.894
Goodness.

00:27:45.977 --> 00:27:48.104
-Hey, Ma-jin!
-Hey!

00:27:48.188 --> 00:27:50.273
-Hello.
-It must've been a rough journey.

00:27:50.356 --> 00:27:51.816
Goodness, it must've been hard.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.652
Mr. Kang and Ms. Oh,
it's a shame to see you go.

00:27:54.736 --> 00:27:55.945
Let us meet again, okay?

00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:57.280
-Yes.
-My goodness.

00:27:57.363 --> 00:27:58.364
Hey, Ha-neul.

00:27:58.448 --> 00:28:00.700
What are you waiting for?
Come and say goodbye.

00:28:04.829 --> 00:28:05.955
Don't go.

00:28:06.039 --> 00:28:07.874
-Here.
-Okay.

00:28:09.751 --> 00:28:10.710
Thank you so much.

00:28:10.793 --> 00:28:12.295
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

00:28:12.378 --> 00:28:13.963
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:28:14.047 --> 00:28:16.674
It's such a shame to see you go.
Now, come along.

00:28:16.758 --> 00:28:18.510
Are you sure you can do this alone?

00:28:19.385 --> 00:28:22.472
Mr. Kang, going around on foot
is the best way to do sales.

00:28:22.555 --> 00:28:25.391
I'll see the numbers working
once I put my feet to work.

00:28:25.475 --> 00:28:28.269
Of course, it'd be great
if I could sell all 140 at once.

00:28:28.353 --> 00:28:30.897
But I don't care if I can't do that.

00:28:31.439 --> 00:28:34.484
If I sell ten helmets
to 14 different places,

00:28:34.567 --> 00:28:40.240
there will be at least one or two places
where I sell big and hit the jackpot.

00:28:40.949 --> 00:28:41.866
It will happen.

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:43.368
And I'm not here alone.

00:28:44.661 --> 00:28:49.749
Now, we're ahead of the game
with my experience and connections.

00:28:51.334 --> 00:28:53.253
-See you in Seoul.
-Okay.

00:28:53.336 --> 00:28:54.212
-Wait.
-What?

00:28:54.295 --> 00:28:56.339
Let's do a cheer for our business.

00:28:56.422 --> 00:28:58.550
-Why are we doing this?
-On the count of three.

00:28:58.633 --> 00:29:01.344
-Typhoon Trading, let's go!
-Let's go.

00:29:01.427 --> 00:29:02.887
We weren't in sync.

00:29:02.971 --> 00:29:04.889
-Let's do this.
-Yes, let's do it!

00:29:04.973 --> 00:29:05.807
Let's do this!

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:07.976
-All right. Go now.
-You can do it!

00:29:08.059 --> 00:29:09.394
-Come and visit, okay?
-Okay.

00:29:09.477 --> 00:29:10.687
My goodness.

00:29:11.729 --> 00:29:12.814
Mr. Kang.

00:29:13.606 --> 00:29:16.067
Keep an eye on my dear Ms. Oh, will you?

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:18.403
Since when was she your dear Ms. Oh?

00:29:19.028 --> 00:29:19.946
Be careful.

00:29:20.738 --> 00:29:23.950
It's such a shame to see you go…

00:29:25.034 --> 00:29:29.664
Ms. Oh, I'll make money
and bring some dried mangoes home.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:32.041
-And big peanuts!
-Okay!

00:29:32.125 --> 00:29:33.418
Mangoes are for me.

00:29:34.043 --> 00:29:35.670
Make sure you visit!

00:29:35.753 --> 00:29:38.047
-Bye!
-Bye! Be careful!

00:29:38.715 --> 00:29:40.300
Drive safely!

00:29:47.223 --> 00:29:48.224
Bye!

00:29:54.814 --> 00:29:56.399
Why isn't she here yet?

00:30:01.195 --> 00:30:02.989
It's about time she came back.

00:30:06.659 --> 00:30:07.827
Mi-seon!

00:30:09.913 --> 00:30:11.497
Hey, Beom.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:13.374
You're back!

00:30:13.458 --> 00:30:16.252
-We're back.
-It must've been exhausting.

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:19.172
-Was it a tough journey?
-No.

00:30:19.881 --> 00:30:23.134
-We had a good journey.
-You look so thin.

00:30:23.801 --> 00:30:25.511
-Have you been well?
-Hey.

00:30:25.595 --> 00:30:28.264
-I'm home, Grandma.
-You're back, Mi-seon!

00:30:28.348 --> 00:30:29.682
-Mi-seon!
-Hey.

00:30:30.558 --> 00:30:32.602
-I got you a present.
-You did? Show me.

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.357
Did you miss me or not?

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.524
Did you or did you not?

00:30:39.484 --> 00:30:41.486
Let's see them.

00:30:42.612 --> 00:30:43.738
That's a lot.

00:30:43.821 --> 00:30:45.323
You got so many things.

00:30:45.406 --> 00:30:47.116
Why did you get so much stuff?
That's mine.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.034
-No, mine.
-No.

00:30:48.117 --> 00:30:53.873
Does the US Army Base have
a lot of great things like these?

00:30:53.957 --> 00:30:56.459
This could look tacky
if the wrong person holds this.

00:30:56.542 --> 00:30:58.711
It looks good only on someone like me.

00:30:58.795 --> 00:31:01.130
Tae-poong has such good taste.

00:31:01.214 --> 00:31:03.758
-It's pretty.
-Hey, you.

00:31:04.759 --> 00:31:06.010
Was this the best you could do?

00:31:07.053 --> 00:31:09.889
What is this? It's blue!

00:31:09.973 --> 00:31:13.351
It makes me look like a ghost!
Didn't you see anything in pink or red?

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:16.646
Darn it. You're the worst.
Why did you get me this?

00:31:16.729 --> 00:31:18.523
-Thank you.
-It's tasty.

00:31:18.606 --> 00:31:20.233
Is there anything else?

00:31:20.316 --> 00:31:21.818
She's a ghost.

00:31:21.901 --> 00:31:24.070
-Stop it, ma'am.
-She's a ghost.

00:31:24.153 --> 00:31:26.698
-Mi-seon, what is this?
-What?

00:31:26.781 --> 00:31:29.867
You can wear it to work.
It looked comfortable.

00:31:30.451 --> 00:31:31.953
Darn it. Keep it for yourself.

00:31:32.036 --> 00:31:33.663
-This sucks.
-It's cute.

00:31:33.746 --> 00:31:36.082
It's pretty. I'm jealous of you, Mi-ho.

00:31:36.165 --> 00:31:37.125
-Here.
-You can keep it.

00:31:37.208 --> 00:31:38.042
Grandma?

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:40.503
-Goodness, no.
-Eat this.

00:31:41.379 --> 00:31:43.381
-Don't give it to me.
-The banana's delicious.

00:31:50.888 --> 00:31:52.765
Why isn't he home yet?

00:32:09.615 --> 00:32:11.284
It's so cramped.

00:32:11.367 --> 00:32:13.661
Beom, you said you'd sleep with Grandma.

00:32:13.745 --> 00:32:15.538
It's been so long
since we've seen Mi-seon.

00:32:20.209 --> 00:32:24.422
-I'm thirsty, Mi-ho.
-Be quiet and swallow your spit.

00:32:26.007 --> 00:32:27.133
Go to sleep.

00:32:51.991 --> 00:32:56.245
ACCOUNT BALANCE: 126,550 WON

00:33:41.666 --> 00:33:44.502
CEO KANG JIN-YOUNG

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.422
REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

00:34:29.505 --> 00:34:32.758
CONTRACT AMOUNT: 70 MILLION WON
REMAINING BALANCE: 24 MILLION WON

00:34:40.725 --> 00:34:42.476
CEO'S OFFICE

00:35:18.221 --> 00:35:19.555
I'll be back.

00:35:21.933 --> 00:35:23.100
I promise.

00:35:55.591 --> 00:35:56.592
Watch out.

00:35:58.844 --> 00:36:00.846
-Stop pushing.
-Please don't push.

00:36:08.854 --> 00:36:10.898
EUROPE ALSO SUFFERS
FROM UNEMPLOYMENT CRISIS

00:36:10.982 --> 00:36:12.942
Stop looking at me and read the paper.

00:36:17.822 --> 00:36:18.739
Are you okay?

00:36:20.157 --> 00:36:22.702
Sure, I'm fine.

00:36:26.205 --> 00:36:27.331
-Watch it.
-Come on.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:33.546
I'm sorry.

00:36:34.755 --> 00:36:36.841
-I'm sorry.
-Stop getting in.

00:36:36.924 --> 00:36:39.385
-I'm so sorry.
-Jeez.

00:36:45.474 --> 00:36:47.018
Except that we're standing too close.

00:37:11.208 --> 00:37:12.084
Thank you.

00:37:12.626 --> 00:37:15.171
-It's hot. Be careful.
-It's surely hot.

00:37:16.047 --> 00:37:17.465
-Thank you.
-Sure.

00:37:21.344 --> 00:37:22.636
Eat up.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.805
-It's so hot.
-Is it?

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:30.853
What is it?

00:37:35.483 --> 00:37:36.984
-Your lips.
-Right.

00:37:37.068 --> 00:37:38.402
-Your lips.
-Is something on it?

00:37:39.195 --> 00:37:40.404
Thank you.

00:37:45.951 --> 00:37:46.952
It's so hot.

00:37:51.999 --> 00:37:53.626
-Oh, my.
-My gosh.

00:37:55.002 --> 00:37:56.128
Why did you…

00:37:58.297 --> 00:38:01.217
Why did you pull out the straw?

00:38:02.718 --> 00:38:04.011
You can wipe it now.

00:38:05.304 --> 00:38:07.014
-Is it in my nose?
-No, you're fine.

00:38:09.266 --> 00:38:11.102
-Be careful.
-Okay.

00:38:18.192 --> 00:38:19.026
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:20.653
-Thank you.
-Bye.

00:38:23.364 --> 00:38:24.365
Wait, Ms. Oh.

00:38:25.324 --> 00:38:26.450
We aren't going there.

00:38:28.077 --> 00:38:30.579
-We aren't going to work?
-Well, we are.

00:38:32.039 --> 00:38:34.166
-But we aren't going in that direction.
-What?

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.294
-Our office is this way.
-No, we're over here.

00:38:38.087 --> 00:38:39.130
What?

00:38:41.549 --> 00:38:43.134
What have you done now?

00:38:55.479 --> 00:38:56.355
Stand right there.

00:39:00.568 --> 00:39:02.987
Oh, my gosh, Mr. Kang.

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:05.948
What is this?

00:39:06.031 --> 00:39:08.033
-The thing is--
-What?

00:39:08.701 --> 00:39:09.827
Hey, over here.

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:12.621
You just sent me a random address.
What is this?

00:39:14.039 --> 00:39:15.541
-Hello, Mr. Bae.
-Hey.

00:39:16.542 --> 00:39:19.545
Allow me to present Typhoon Trading.

00:39:26.594 --> 00:39:28.762
I'm not really into fried chicken.

00:39:28.846 --> 00:39:30.931
Why did you call him?

00:39:31.015 --> 00:39:33.517
I was raised with good food,
so palm oil doesn't work with me.

00:39:34.393 --> 00:39:36.937
Wipe that margarine off your face first.

00:39:39.565 --> 00:39:41.317
Anyway, let's go inside.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.359
-Okay.
-All right.

00:39:42.443 --> 00:39:44.487
TYPHOON TRADING

00:40:06.133 --> 00:40:09.970
This is Typhoon Trading version 2.0.

00:40:10.054 --> 00:40:12.932
Mr. Kang, when did you make this decision?

00:40:16.143 --> 00:40:17.394
It started in Thailand.

00:40:19.355 --> 00:40:23.067
Things were too hectic back then,
so I didn't get a chance to tell you.

00:40:23.943 --> 00:40:27.655
And our team wasn't in good spirits.

00:40:29.615 --> 00:40:30.616
Also,

00:40:32.284 --> 00:40:36.705
I needed some money
to handle my responsibilities as the CEO.

00:40:41.126 --> 00:40:44.588
But because I made you move here
without discussing this beforehand,

00:40:45.422 --> 00:40:46.549
I am very sorry…

00:40:50.052 --> 00:40:50.970
about that matter.

00:40:51.762 --> 00:40:53.222
-No.
-It's okay.

00:40:54.473 --> 00:40:56.600
Is there something on the floor?

00:40:56.684 --> 00:40:57.810
-The floor?
-What's that?

00:40:57.893 --> 00:41:02.565
If you think about it, we couldn't afford
an office like that in our situation.

00:41:02.648 --> 00:41:04.525
Please stop, Mr. Kang.

00:41:04.608 --> 00:41:08.028
It's not like we'll stick around here
for a long time, right?

00:41:08.112 --> 00:41:11.824
Of course not.
We'll go back to our office.

00:41:11.907 --> 00:41:14.159
-Yes, of course.
-Yes.

00:41:14.702 --> 00:41:16.996
Was this previously a pub?

00:41:17.705 --> 00:41:21.709
It was a pub my friend ran,
but he's taking some time off.

00:41:21.792 --> 00:41:24.837
So, we're using this for the time being.

00:41:25.796 --> 00:41:26.964
It has running water, right?

00:41:27.047 --> 00:41:29.758
Of course, it does.
It has electricity too.

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:32.928
The Internet modem works as well.

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:35.514
Are you all right?

00:41:39.351 --> 00:41:40.894
It's working fine.

00:41:42.396 --> 00:41:43.606
Did they move out in a hurry?

00:41:44.607 --> 00:41:47.693
Look at this place.
We could start frying chicken now.

00:41:49.486 --> 00:41:54.617
MOMO'S PUB

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:57.703
-Let's do this!
-Go!

00:41:57.786 --> 00:41:59.038
All right!

00:42:07.671 --> 00:42:09.840
-Careful with your back.
-Let's go!

00:42:10.674 --> 00:42:12.343
-Be careful.
-Careful.

00:42:12.426 --> 00:42:13.761
-All right!
-Be careful.

00:42:13.844 --> 00:42:15.387
Is it that heavy?

00:42:16.055 --> 00:42:17.181
Now, let's move this.

00:42:17.264 --> 00:42:18.390
MONTHLY SCHEDULE AND PLANNER

00:42:24.605 --> 00:42:25.814
Is this okay?

00:42:27.107 --> 00:42:29.026
-Put it this way.
-Turn it around.

00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:30.861
No, go the other way.

00:42:30.944 --> 00:42:32.613
-The other way?
-Wait, no. I'm sorry.

00:42:40.329 --> 00:42:41.830
We're almost done.

00:42:42.665 --> 00:42:43.540
All done.

00:42:43.624 --> 00:42:46.502
THE CONTACT

00:42:46.585 --> 00:42:47.544
CHRISTMAS IN AUGUST

00:43:05.729 --> 00:43:07.356
Has anybody been watering this?

00:43:08.232 --> 00:43:13.946
That was Mr. Koo's duty,
but no one else did it once he left.

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:17.408
-Does that beer machine work?
-It does.

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:20.994
Does it work?

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:26.208
-What?
-This is awesome.

00:43:26.291 --> 00:43:27.501
What are you doing?

00:43:28.544 --> 00:43:32.089
-What do you think you're doing?
-I wanted to test it and see if it worked.

00:43:32.172 --> 00:43:35.676
Why would you test that?
Of course, it'll work once it's plugged.

00:43:36.468 --> 00:43:38.554
-Jeez.
-Okay. I'll be careful from now on.

00:43:38.637 --> 00:43:41.181
Please do. We have to save on everything.

00:43:41.265 --> 00:43:45.978
I mean, we can grab a glass of beer
from time to time while we work now.

00:43:48.605 --> 00:43:49.982
MOMO'S PUB

00:43:50.858 --> 00:43:51.900
These two…

00:43:56.071 --> 00:43:58.198
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hey, you're here.

00:43:58.282 --> 00:44:00.701
-These two are for you, right?
-That's right.

00:44:01.326 --> 00:44:02.703
-Thank you.
-Sure.

00:44:16.717 --> 00:44:19.094
-How much is this, ma'am?
-Yes?

00:44:20.804 --> 00:44:23.348
Why? Do you want one for yourself?

00:44:23.432 --> 00:44:24.391
What?

00:44:25.476 --> 00:44:27.060
You have such a cute smile.

00:44:29.229 --> 00:44:30.230
Take it.

00:44:30.314 --> 00:44:31.690
-You're giving it for free?
-Sure.

00:44:31.774 --> 00:44:32.941
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

00:44:33.025 --> 00:44:34.193
Thank you.

00:44:34.276 --> 00:44:36.069
-Thank you.
-Here. Take this.

00:44:39.782 --> 00:44:41.825
-Goodbye, then.
-Bye.

00:44:44.578 --> 00:44:49.166
I thought it would look shabby,
but it turned out to be a decent office.

00:44:49.249 --> 00:44:51.585
It looks rather cozy.

00:44:51.668 --> 00:44:54.880
What about the kitchen?
Should we use it as a meeting room?

00:44:54.963 --> 00:44:57.799
My friend wanted to use it,
so he asked us to leave it alone.

00:45:04.223 --> 00:45:06.266
We have a freeloader now?

00:45:07.684 --> 00:45:11.146
Did you call me a freeloader?
The lease is in my name.

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:13.065
What is this, Tae-poong?

00:45:13.148 --> 00:45:15.067
You said you'd only use half.

00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:17.861
We're paying 50-50, but you want me
to be locked up in the kitchen?

00:45:17.945 --> 00:45:19.571
-We're paying 50-50?
-I guess so.

00:45:19.655 --> 00:45:21.657
Hey, push this over.

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:25.494
Then you can come out.
We have extra seats, no doubt!

00:45:25.577 --> 00:45:27.621
Stop talking nonsense
and draw the halfway line.

00:45:27.704 --> 00:45:28.997
-Push it!
-Hold on.

00:45:29.081 --> 00:45:30.666
Let's do this, then.

00:45:30.749 --> 00:45:32.543
Give him a hug!

00:45:32.626 --> 00:45:34.753
-What are you doing?
-Okay. Welcome!

00:45:34.836 --> 00:45:36.964
Welcome to Typhoon Family.

00:45:37.047 --> 00:45:38.048
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

00:45:38.131 --> 00:45:39.550
-Welcome!
-I'm glad you're here.

00:45:40.676 --> 00:45:42.219
-How endearing.
-Welcome.

00:45:42.844 --> 00:45:44.096
I'll turn on the light!

00:45:45.764 --> 00:45:47.599
TYPHOON TRADING
MOMO'S PUB

00:45:49.184 --> 00:45:51.019
It's hard to make out both.

00:45:51.103 --> 00:45:53.272
"Momo's Typhoon Trading."

00:45:54.189 --> 00:45:56.191
-Turn it off.
-Turn it off?

00:45:58.694 --> 00:46:00.779
This way, you can see both.

00:46:07.286 --> 00:46:08.370
This way.

00:46:15.252 --> 00:46:16.920
See? I told you.

00:46:17.004 --> 00:46:18.130
They're done for good.

00:46:49.077 --> 00:46:51.622
"Notice of Office Relocation."

00:46:52.497 --> 00:46:53.957
I'm telling you they're done.

00:46:54.791 --> 00:46:57.169
We aren't done.
This is just the beginning.

00:46:58.545 --> 00:47:01.256
The beginning of your suffering.

00:47:07.262 --> 00:47:09.181
Aren't you hot? Have something cold.

00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:13.560
My back hurts.

00:47:22.903 --> 00:47:25.155
-Hey, cheers.
-Cheers.

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:31.995
-Oh, man.
-How's your mother?

00:47:33.121 --> 00:47:34.414
What happened?

00:47:35.999 --> 00:47:38.043
It was human marketing.

00:47:38.126 --> 00:47:39.503
In other words, a pyramid scheme.

00:47:41.129 --> 00:47:45.676
My dear Ms. Kim Eul-nyeo reached
the Sapphire tier with our mortgage money.

00:47:47.594 --> 00:47:52.849
Everyone who reached the jewel tier
was crying together in that office.

00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:56.937
They were Ruby, Sapphire,
and Diamond tiers.

00:47:58.438 --> 00:47:59.856
Doesn't it sound like a fairy tale?

00:48:01.525 --> 00:48:04.027
It must've been upsetting, Nam-mo.

00:48:04.111 --> 00:48:06.279
It's not something
for me to be upset about.

00:48:07.614 --> 00:48:09.074
It's my mom who's struggling.

00:48:11.243 --> 00:48:12.244
My mom

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:14.621
held my hand and cried.

00:48:17.624 --> 00:48:18.792
She said she was sorry.

00:48:22.295 --> 00:48:24.881
But, Tae-poong,
I'm not going down like this.

00:48:26.883 --> 00:48:28.176
I'm the head of my household.

00:48:29.052 --> 00:48:31.096
-I'll live a diligent life.
-Of course.

00:48:31.805 --> 00:48:33.724
Although I'm not sure
what your mom's thinking.

00:48:34.599 --> 00:48:37.477
Also, I'm seeing someone.

00:48:37.561 --> 00:48:40.230
Of course. Although I'm not sure
how that woman feels…

00:48:41.606 --> 00:48:43.316
What? Who is she?

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.027
There's this woman,
the prettiest woman you know.

00:48:47.404 --> 00:48:52.325
She reminds me of an adorable deer
that drinks from a spring in a mountain

00:48:52.409 --> 00:48:56.538
or a girl who lives in the Alps,
just 4,000 m above sea level.

00:48:56.621 --> 00:48:58.081
Anyway, she's that pretty.

00:48:59.291 --> 00:49:01.668
Why, you! Is it Ms. Oh?

00:49:01.752 --> 00:49:03.879
She's more like a tigress from Jirisan!

00:49:03.962 --> 00:49:06.798
Then who is this girl
who resembles the deer in the Alps?

00:49:06.882 --> 00:49:10.010
Hey, go back to your job!
What do you know about love?

00:49:10.093 --> 00:49:12.137
I can never tell what women are thinking.

00:49:12.804 --> 00:49:15.182
You're just a fool
who only knows how to export.

00:49:18.435 --> 00:49:19.644
I mean…

00:49:21.772 --> 00:49:23.482
Don't you start dating after a kiss?

00:49:23.565 --> 00:49:25.567
Are you out of your mind?
You need to marry her!

00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:27.235
-Right?
-Who did you kiss?

00:49:27.861 --> 00:49:30.322
-What?
-Why didn't you tell me? Who was it?

00:49:30.405 --> 00:49:31.823
Is she pretty?

00:49:34.618 --> 00:49:37.496
-Yes.
-Who is it? Tell me.

00:49:41.458 --> 00:49:43.835
It can't be. Not the tigress from Jirisan.

00:49:45.587 --> 00:49:46.546
Is it her?

00:49:47.297 --> 00:49:48.131
Yes.

00:49:49.257 --> 00:49:51.134
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

00:49:51.218 --> 00:49:52.969
Man, this is crazy!

00:49:54.012 --> 00:49:55.138
This is impossible.

00:50:03.063 --> 00:50:03.897
Ms. Oh.

00:50:08.276 --> 00:50:10.278
Right. Thank you.

00:50:17.577 --> 00:50:19.204
-Mi-seon.
-Yes?

00:50:21.915 --> 00:50:22.916
Here, have some tea.

00:50:24.167 --> 00:50:25.210
Thank you.

00:50:27.754 --> 00:50:30.507
What's going on?
Why do you two look so close?

00:50:31.091 --> 00:50:32.968
Actually, we are--

00:50:33.051 --> 00:50:34.970
I came down with a cold.

00:50:36.847 --> 00:50:38.682
Don't cough at me.
I don't want to catch it.

00:50:39.683 --> 00:50:40.851
I'm sorry.

00:50:42.602 --> 00:50:44.437
You're coughing? Then…

00:50:53.321 --> 00:50:55.490
I didn't know she caught a cold.

00:50:56.783 --> 00:50:58.368
Wait a second, Ms. Oh.

00:50:58.994 --> 00:51:00.912
Let me get this from now on.

00:51:00.996 --> 00:51:01.955
Huh? Why?

00:51:02.038 --> 00:51:04.124
Ms. Oh? That doesn't sound right.

00:51:05.166 --> 00:51:07.878
-What should I call you?
-What do you mean?

00:51:09.212 --> 00:51:10.171
I mean,

00:51:11.673 --> 00:51:13.216
we're now dating, so…

00:51:15.218 --> 00:51:16.303
Mr. Kang.

00:51:17.053 --> 00:51:19.681
When did we say we'd start dating?

00:51:21.141 --> 00:51:23.977
Last night, we kissed…

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.855
The kiss?

00:51:26.938 --> 00:51:28.023
It's not that…

00:51:28.106 --> 00:51:33.820
People don't start dating
just because it happened once.

00:51:33.904 --> 00:51:36.448
We don't do that in this day and age.

00:51:36.531 --> 00:51:38.283
Then why did you kiss me?

00:51:39.743 --> 00:51:42.454
-Were you toying with me?
-No, it's not that.

00:51:42.537 --> 00:51:43.747
Are you coming?

00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:46.458
-Should I do all the work?
-I'm coming.

00:51:47.584 --> 00:51:49.836
-We'll talk later.
-Wait a second.

00:51:52.672 --> 00:51:55.884
What about staying by my side?

00:52:02.182 --> 00:52:05.352
What do you mean?
We're together at work and at home.

00:52:07.979 --> 00:52:09.689
We should talk again later.

00:52:09.773 --> 00:52:11.358
We're running late.

00:52:14.361 --> 00:52:16.029
He didn't even ask me out,

00:52:16.112 --> 00:52:19.741
so why does he suddenly think
that we're dating?

00:52:24.871 --> 00:52:27.582
Yes, I get it. I know the answer.

00:52:28.083 --> 00:52:29.376
She doesn't like you.

00:52:30.043 --> 00:52:32.420
-Then why did she kiss me?
-Why do you chew gum?

00:52:32.504 --> 00:52:36.132
-Because I get bored.
-That's exactly it. You know the answer.

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.843
Hey, you're way too slow.

00:52:38.927 --> 00:52:41.304
No, it wasn't like that.

00:52:41.388 --> 00:52:42.681
Jeez. You and your pride.

00:52:43.348 --> 00:52:45.684
Goodness gracious. Hold on.

00:52:45.767 --> 00:52:46.810
What time is it?

00:52:47.435 --> 00:52:48.853
Wait, did you buy a cell phone?

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:51.481
Don't you have one?

00:52:51.564 --> 00:52:54.859
You should get one.
How can you run a business without it?

00:52:54.943 --> 00:52:56.611
Right. I have to go to your place today.

00:52:56.695 --> 00:52:58.530
-My place? Why?
-Right? Why am I going?

00:52:59.239 --> 00:53:00.782
Oh, it's to hang out with you.

00:53:00.865 --> 00:53:02.534
-With me?
-Yes, I'll go there first.

00:53:03.201 --> 00:53:04.202
Bye.

00:53:08.456 --> 00:53:09.416
With me?

00:53:09.499 --> 00:53:11.584

00:55:04.781 --> 00:55:05.865
No.

00:55:07.117 --> 00:55:08.827
I prefer memories over records.

00:55:34.227 --> 00:55:36.062
Let's hang out, Tae-poong!

00:55:38.481 --> 00:55:39.399
Hello.

00:55:39.482 --> 00:55:41.568
Who's that?

00:55:43.027 --> 00:55:44.696
Tae-poong said he'd be late.

00:55:44.779 --> 00:55:46.114
Really?

00:55:46.865 --> 00:55:48.283
That's weird.

00:55:50.577 --> 00:55:53.204
I even brought some clothes for him.

00:55:53.997 --> 00:55:57.792
I said I didn't want to buy them.
Why do you keep bothering me?

00:55:58.793 --> 00:56:00.670
I got some for you too.

00:56:01.462 --> 00:56:06.092
-Have you had dinner?
-No, I actually haven't eaten dinner.

00:56:07.177 --> 00:56:09.429
-What is that?
-I'll show you later.

00:56:09.512 --> 00:56:10.722
Goodness.

00:56:13.099 --> 00:56:14.893
Wang Nam-mo.

00:56:19.189 --> 00:56:21.608
Goodness, Mr. Wang.

00:56:21.691 --> 00:56:28.531
You're even good at doing chores.
You're rather decent for a man.

00:56:30.408 --> 00:56:32.368
I'll cook you a delicious meal, ma'am.

00:56:38.082 --> 00:56:41.169
-You look great, Grandma.
-Yes, it looks great on you.

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:45.173
You look so cute. How adorable.

00:56:45.256 --> 00:56:47.091
-This is nice.
-How cute.

00:56:47.175 --> 00:56:49.594
I don't think these are right for me.

00:56:49.677 --> 00:56:51.888
Hey, Beom. Don't you
know anything about hip-hop?

00:56:51.971 --> 00:56:54.098
I don't. How is this called hip-hop?

00:56:54.182 --> 00:56:56.517
You should thank him
for the thought. Sit down.

00:56:56.601 --> 00:56:59.354
Okay. Fine. Thank you.

00:56:59.437 --> 00:57:03.608
I don't see anything
that Tae-poong can wear.

00:57:06.152 --> 00:57:07.403
Goodness.

00:57:07.487 --> 00:57:10.782
-Are these mine?
-Yes, they're yours.

00:57:10.865 --> 00:57:13.284
Thank you so much.
I can't wait to wear them.

00:57:13.368 --> 00:57:15.119
I thought you were with Mr. Kang.

00:57:15.662 --> 00:57:17.038
What? We left together.

00:57:18.164 --> 00:57:20.625
Mi-seon. I got you some too.

00:57:20.708 --> 00:57:23.753
This floral pattern
is the most popular in Dongdaemun now.

00:57:23.836 --> 00:57:25.588
Give me those.

00:57:25.672 --> 00:57:27.757
-Those are mine.
-Yes, give them to her.

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:28.925
Yes, these are yours.

00:57:29.008 --> 00:57:31.302
-These look warm.
-These are tights.

00:57:31.386 --> 00:57:32.762
-Yes, they're tights.
-Yes.

00:57:32.845 --> 00:57:35.557
-You got socks and pants.
-These are for Mi-seon.

00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:38.142
Here you go. Thank you for the food.

00:57:38.226 --> 00:57:39.769
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you.

00:57:39.852 --> 00:57:41.229
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

00:57:42.063 --> 00:57:43.565
Grandma, go ahead.

00:57:46.859 --> 00:57:49.529
-Have some rice.
-Watch it.

00:57:49.612 --> 00:57:52.282
Beom, is that how you were raised?

00:57:53.074 --> 00:57:54.867
-Come on.
-Eat some more.

00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:58.830
-Make sure to chew carefully.
-Goodness.

00:57:58.913 --> 00:58:00.665
-Have this, Beom.
-Goodness.

00:58:00.748 --> 00:58:03.042
It's nice to eat with many people.

Tell me.

00:58:23.187 --> 00:58:24.314
Where is it?

00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:28.484
Did she accept it?

00:58:28.568 --> 00:58:30.737
She said she'll think about it.

00:58:32.113 --> 00:58:37.118
Now that she has accepted it,
her heart is bound to follow.

00:58:59.641 --> 00:59:02.185

CEO KANG JIN-YOUNG

00:59:25.833 --> 00:59:27.251
It's not so bad here, is it?

00:59:29.379 --> 00:59:31.506
It's our first day,
so let's stay together.

00:59:40.264 --> 00:59:43.017
There's way too much work to do.

00:59:51.818 --> 00:59:57.740
Man, he was such a meticulous person.

01:00:00.034 --> 01:00:01.661
Every inch is covered.

01:00:05.998 --> 01:00:07.959
ACCOUNT BOOK, 1989

01:00:08.626 --> 01:00:10.628
Year 1989.

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:18.010
AUGUST

01:00:21.222 --> 01:00:23.141
August 11th.

01:00:25.184 --> 01:00:28.938
August 17th, 18th, 19th.

01:00:32.358 --> 01:00:35.027
Did he rip out the next page
because there were errors?

01:00:59.469 --> 01:01:00.970
Where's my IOU?

01:01:02.597 --> 01:01:03.931
My promissory note.

01:01:06.017 --> 01:01:07.894
I can't find it.

01:01:20.031 --> 01:01:21.657
End-of-the-day mark.

01:01:23.367 --> 01:01:24.744
This is crossed out.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.039
"Data entry error. Next page."

01:01:30.583 --> 01:01:33.419
So, he would never rip out a page
even if he made errors.

01:01:38.841 --> 01:01:40.635
Year 1989.

01:01:43.471 --> 01:01:44.806
Why is this page gone?

01:01:57.401 --> 01:02:01.948

TYPHOON FAMILY

01:02:53.165 --> 01:02:55.376
What exactly do you want to do?

01:02:55.459 --> 01:02:57.378
A totally safe government project.

01:02:57.461 --> 01:03:00.423
It would've been better
if Mr. Koo was here.

01:03:00.506 --> 01:03:03.217
"The king of darkness
will descend upon this world."

01:03:03.301 --> 01:03:04.135
Hey, Mr. Koo.

01:03:04.218 --> 01:03:05.094
Stop it! Stop!

01:03:05.177 --> 01:03:08.180
I've lost my way,
so don't look for me again.

01:03:08.264 --> 01:03:10.808
I don't want to be dependent
on emotional comfort.

01:03:10.892 --> 01:03:13.519
Let's keep our focus
on work matters. Nothing more.

01:03:13.603 --> 01:03:17.064
If there are multiple bidders,
it goes to a competitive bid.

01:03:17.148 --> 01:03:19.233
We have to win this project.

01:03:19.317 --> 01:03:20.151
Please help us.

01:03:20.902 --> 01:03:22.111
Please help Typhoon Trading.

01:03:23.195 --> 01:03:27.199
